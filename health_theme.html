<p>

A constellation of new health-related activities and technologies,
supported by research and rolling out slowly into medical practice,
holds the promise of better health for everyone. Underlying these
activities are the collection, analysis, and sharing of data. Driving
the interest in these activities are such pressing needs in the health
care system as:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Controlling chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension to
prevent progression and complications

</li>

<li>

Finding more effective and less intrusive treatments for a range of
diseases, and doing so faster

</li>

<li>

Lowering system-wide costs, or at least reducing the rate of increase

</li>

<li>

Reducing medical errors

</li>

<li>

Improving patients' sense of control over their care and their destiny

</li>

<li>

Easing stress on practitioners and caregivers

</li>

</ul>

<p>

What new technologies show the most promise? Why do some seem to
languish despite their apparent advantages? How do all these things
depend on each other, and what technologies and activities need to be
adopted in tandem?

</p>
<p>

The large trends in these ground-breaking approaches--as well as the
things that stand in their way--form the subjects of this paper. This
is not a catalog of applications or technologies, but a high-level
investigation into their potential. The paper's themes will come home
to lots of readers:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Anyone with a career in medicine and the enormous health care
industries will see big changes in the field. These industries aren't
likely to shrink dramatically or be disintermediated as have travel
agents, bookstores, many newspapers, or much of the music recording
industry, but some of their functions will disappear while others leap
into the twenty-first century.

</li>

<li>

Computer experts, data scientists, and other hi-tech professionals
will <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/big-growth-forecast-health-it-market">stream
into health care</a>, where they will stumble upon very unusual norms
and activities.

</li>

<li>

If you're concerned about the economic future of nearly any country in
the world, you worry about the exploding costs of health care. These
are being driven by aging populations as well as new diagnostic
techniques and treatments that provide astonishing advances in
extending human life, but at great expense, and are exacerbated by
inefficient business and clinical processes, lack of information
liquidity, and overlapping, sometimes contradictory regulatory
demands. Smart health technologies, including patient engagement,
could help those increases to level off.

</li>

<li>

Everybody will feel the shift. Your interactions with this new health
care system--and for the first time, we might really be able to ennoble
our grab-bag of medical practices and technologies by calling them a
"system"--will differ depending on whether you are young or old, live
in a city or the country, are (currently) healthy or chronically
ill--but the interaction will be very different from what most people
have now.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

What are some of the changes coming over the horizon?

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Sensors are checking how some elderly residents move around their
homes, registering signs of inactivity that may indicate ill health or
atypical patterns suggesting disorientation.

</li>

<li>

Behavioral conditions are being treated by games, some of which produce
lasting improvements, such as exposing victims of PTSD to situations
that promote adaptation, or asking people with ADHD to performa task
and throwing distractions at them.

</li>

<li>

Large-scale data analysis of patient reactions to drugs turn up
adverse effects that wre not found during clinical trials, and prompt
reconsideration of the sterling trust placed in conventional trials.

</li>

<li>

Electronic record exchange allows a patient to walk into a hospital
hundreds of miles from where he has previously been treated and offer
doctors a complete medical history, including key information such as
drug allergies.

</li>

<li>

Mobile phones allow people in isolated rural areas, even in developing
nations, snap photos of medical problems or even measure vital signs
and get advice from remote doctors.

</li>

<li>

Researchers are starting to release not only articles about their
research, but the data used to reach their conclusions, allowing other
researchers to check their work and combine the data from multiple
experiments.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Technology is always a tool, and one whose use rises, falls, and is
changed by the people and organizations who use it. Technology also
introduces risks whose effects in medicine can cost lives. Although
this article does not delve into social policy or organizational
change, I'll look at some of the impacts these have on the
technologies, and vice versa.

</p>

<p>

Health reformer Arien Malec delineated (in
a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEOF1hKp21c">video-taped
presentation</a>) the tension between technology and the personal
touch. In earlier ages of medicine we enjoyed a personal relationship
with a doctor who knew everything about us and our families--but he
couldn't actually do much for us for lack of effective treatments. Now
we have medicines and machinery that would awe earlier generations,
but we rarely develop the relationships that can help us overcome
chronic conditions.

</p>

<p>

Communications tools can restore the balance, allowing us to make
better use of treatments while creating beneficial
relationships. Indeed, a relationship with a single physician is no
longer enough. Communication tools can pull patient, physician, and
other experts such as physical therapists, social workers, and
nutritionists into a function team.

</p>

<p>

The technologies offer glowing possibilities, but suffer from complex
problems that bedevil their application beyond proofs of
concept. We'll now focus in on various areas.

</p>

<a name="device_sensor">
<h2>Devices, sensors, and patient monitoring</h2>
</a>

<p>

The medical devices that normally come to mind are enormous, clanking
machines that cost a million dollars or more. Their output tends to
run through labs, radiologists, or other oracles that take several
days to hand down results. But miniaturization is striking at medical
equipment, as at other technologies, and are bringing health data into
the hands of ordinary people.

</p>

<a name="qs_selves">
<h3>From the Quantified Self to Our Selves</h3>
</a>

<p>

Attendees at the
high-profile <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/consumer-electronics-show-will-highlight-new-ways-to-collect-biometric-data/2014/01/05/e8eac584-74c4-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html">Consumer
Electronics Show</a> at the beginning of 2014 lost themselves in a sea
of personal monitoring devices. The field is on the verge of becoming
mainstream,
<a href="http://www.fiercemobileit.com/story/research-mobile-health-app-market-quadruple-2016/2011-11-30">with
the use of apps to expand rapidly</a>, whether or not these particular
early consumer devices take off.

</p>
<p>

Trends include:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Fitbits and other wearable measurement devices are <a
href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/wearable-fitness-devices-see-historic-surge-popularity">surging
in popularity</a>. Many of these measure not only activity, but
health-related vital signs such as pulse, blood pressure, and oxygen
consumption.

</li>

<li>

Devices are becoming easier and friendlier to use. For instance,
diabetes patients need to measure glucose levels to avoid fainting and
other
complications. <a href="http://www.medgadget.com/2013/10/non-invasive-measurement-of-blood-glucose-levels-using-glucotrack-interview.html">Non-invasive
measurement devices</a> avoid the need to prick their
skin. The <a href="http://theheartcheck.com/products/pen_device.html">HeartCheck
Pen</a> is a small, pen-sized device that takes readings from the
thumbs when they are both pressed onto the sensor pads.
The <a href="http://bionym.com/"> Nymi</a> is a bracelet that measures
one's ECG from the wrist and fingertip.

</li>

<li>

Such things as wristbands or finger clips may soon come to seem
quaintly awkward, with <a href="http://spie.org/x105127.xml">even
greater compression along the way</a>. Reductions in size democratize
medicine in many ways: by making devices cheaper, by making them more
appealing and comfortable (a critical consideration for widespread
adoption), and by reducing power requirements. Sensors to warn of
concussions can be <a
href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/remote-sensors-making-play-concussion-fray">worn
under sports helmets</a> or embedded directly in them, although <a
href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/15/health/youth-head-sensors/">their
accuracy is disputed</a>.

</li>

<li>

Sensors embedded in pill boxes can <a
href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/study-shows-promise-electronic-pill-bottle">notify
doctors when the patients have taken their medication</a>. This can
help clinicians remind patients and <a
href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-03/acoc-prv030613.php">encourage
medication adherence</a>, which is a major problem in maintaining
health because so many patients forget their pills or need urging to
sense the importance of keeping up the regimen. If smart packaging
sounds like science fiction, just consider <a
href="http://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-08-fda-electronic-chips-medications.html">ingestible
pills</a> that work together with a body patch and a smart phone to
signal when they're digested.

</li>

<li>

Robots are
being <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/mobile/10-medical-robots-that-could-change-healthcare/d/d-id/1107696">increasingly
deployed in hospitals</a>, and will eventually turn up in the home as well.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Although some people can benefit individually from reading and
interpreting the displays on their devices, the data is most valuable
when inserted into a patient record and combined with data from other
users. In a patient record, the data can be <a
href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2013/09/ginger-io-putting-the-patient-provider-connection-at-the-center.html">checked
by clinical experts and be mined for trends</a>. Combining data from
many users enables such benefits as group support and finding
dangerous areas of divergence.

</p>

<a name="individual_home">
<h3>The role of the individual</h3>
</a>

<p>

Dueling trends are at work here. On the one hand, consumer devices is
leading toward the <a
href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-03/fitness-apps-eclipse-3-d-tvs-as-digital-health-reaches-ces-tech.html">
vision expressed by health IT leader Samir Damani: "We are really
moving from a doctor-centric society to a patient-centric
society."</a> On the other, sensors can bring the clinic into the home
in a rather intrusive way. Obviously, consumers will rebel against
monitoring unless they feel like partners making their own health
better with the aid of the clinician and technology.

</p>
<p>

So the trend in handling chronic conditions, the difficulties of
aging, recovery from traumatic events and surgery--really, anything
that benefits from close attention by clinicians--is to do it right in
the environment where the patient spends her time. The Institute for
the Future writes, "Health care is moving from an acute, episodic care
model to a more continuous, chronic care model." (Page 11
of <a href="http://www.iftf.org/uploads/media/SR-1194%20Booting%20Up%20Mobile%20Health.pdf">this
PDF</a>). This paper also lays out the move from the professional
setting to the patient's environment, and the crucial role that mobile
devices and sensors in the hands of patients will play.

</p>
<p>

A consortium of providers formalized this concept in
the <a href="http://pcmh.ahrq.gov">patient centered medical home</a>
(PCMH),
which <a href="http://ahier.blogspot.com/2009/10/patient-centered-medical-home.html">covers
new options in treatment, monitoring, and reimbursement</a>. Patient
engagement in the home doesn't revolve around technology: it could
accomplished through follow-up phone calls and visits. But the burden
on both the patient and the caregivers can be made much lighter
through technology, whether it's simple reports by a patient through
her phone or sensors that track such things as whether the patient is
moving around the house, how her weight changes each day, and whether
she takes her medication. Research has even identified forms of
movement that suggest disorientation.

</p>
<p>

As we've seen, making the patient feel like an empowered partner in
her care, rather than a disparaged target of snooping, is key to
success. A PCMH works together with outreach by clinicians to keep a
patient in her home. This can contribute considerably to quality of
life improvements and the cost savings of keeping elderly people out
of assisted care. Many PCMH initiatives depend on close human contact
such as visiting nurses, with minimal technology. Studies show that <a
href="http://www.hitconsultant.net/2013/09/11/rhode-island-patient-centered-medical-home-pilot-reduces-ed-visits/">these innovations
reduce hospital admissions for chronically ill patients</a>, and
particularly
<a
href="http://www.pcpcc.org/sites/default/files/1658_McCarthy_care_transitions_synthesis_v2.pdf">re-admissions
within 30 days after being discharged from a hospital</a>, a measure
that has excited hospital administrators ever since the Centers for
Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services started in 2012 to penalize hospitals
for such readmissions.

</p>

<p>

And the home is not the only place that can join the clinic and the
hospital as places where health coordination takes place--other
important places in people's lives, such as <a
href="http://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/beacon-community-program/beacon-support-childrens-health-lessons-learned/">schools</a>,
can as well.

</p>

<p>

What comes after the PCMH? Naturally,
the <a href="http://www.govhealthit.com/news/cms-funded-medical-neighborhood-pilot-launch-month">patient-centered
medical neighborhood</a>, which uses data about all the patients in a
clinician's practice to draw conclusions about public health. This
local use of data, however, just hints at the power made available by
integrating data across societies, a theme we'll explore more under
<a href="#aco_integrated">accountable care organizations</a>.

</p>

<a name="barrier_device">
<h3>Barriers to devices and sensors</h3>
</a>

<p>

In addition to cultural aversion, the barriers that hold back adoption
of sensor technologies include:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

Cost

</dt>

<dd>

If we can prevent emergency room visits or other costly treatments, a
medical device comes cheap at almost any price. But no one can
guarantee that they are so effective. In the meantime, most people
still think twice before investing in them.

</dd>

<dt>

Efficacy

</dt>

<dd>

It takes a long time and a lot of money to establish that any medical
treatment is safe and works better than a placebo. Small devices
present fewer headaches than medications because they are unlikely to
pose any safety problems, and experimental trials are much simpler
than drug trials. Still, to line up people with the right combination
of medical conditions, ensure they follow instructions, and measure
effects (especially over a long time period) is a big job. We'll look
at the challenges of clinical
trials <a href="#clinical_research">later in this article</a>. Being
poorly tested, most apps are not appealing or particularly effective,
so <a href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/report-paints-grim-diabetes-app-use-mHealth-mobile">few
of them are downloaded</a> by a lot of people, and far fewer are used
over a long period of time.

</dd>

<dt>

Simplicity

</dt>

<dd>

Consumers who will spend days setting up a home entertainment center
seem to lose patience when it comes to devices that improve their
health. If the interface is more than a single button, many will give
up at the start. Simplicity must also be the rule in displays.

</dd>

<dt>

Overmeasurement

</dt>

<dd>

People can get compulsive when measuring themselves, and overinterpret
changes from day to day or hour to hour. Measuring your blood pressure
can raise your blood pressure! In general, throwing data into a bucket
doesn't improve our knowledge; we should determine our goals first and
then collect the data that we can process to help reach the goals.

</dd>

<dt>

Interoperability

</dt>

<dd>

When an environment contains multiple sensors and devices, whether in
the home or in the hospital, good care requires them to work
together. Some standards exist to help devices communicate, such as
the Data Distribution Service (DDS), MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT),
and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). In an age where
coordinated systems keep airplanes on course, it's ridiculous that
most medical devices are not designed to work with other devices.

</dd>

<dt>

Integration with records

</dt>

<dd>

Before data can enter patient records, these records must be designed
to accept patient data, and appropriate privacy controls must be in
place. Few electronic health systems currently accept data from
patients. Furthermore, patients will be tempted to falsify data under
some circumstances (such as when employee reward programs for health
improvement are in place), so there must be technical measures to
prevent tampering with device output. Established clinicians
are <a href="http://www.hl7standards.com/blog/2014/01/09/pghd/">predisposed
to mistrust patient data</a>.

</dd>

</dl>

<p>

Although most manufacturers of consumer devices are careful to label
them for "fitness" rather than "health," there is a point where the
use of some devices trespasses into the realm regulated by
government. The FDA has even declared that it has jurisdiction
over <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-to-regulate-some-medical-related-apps/">mobile
phone apps that have clear medical purposes</a>, although the agency
is doing its best to keep its hands off popular devices and apps for
casual use.

</p>

<a name="using_data">
<h2>Using data: records, open data, and open research</h2>
</a>

<p>

Just as we don't think often about the electrons coursing through most
of the tools we use in twenty-first century life (until the number of
bars on the screen reaches an alarming low), we don't think about the
data that connects us either. For the devices covered in the previous
sections, data is paramount because it's what we want from them in the
first place. Data injects power throughout the rest of the health care
system as well. This section will look first at how data is stored,
and then at some of the ways we can improve health through better data
use.

</p>

<a name="ehr">
<h3>Electronic health systems</h3>
</a>

<p>

Walking into clinics where staff carry around paper records makes you
feel like you caught an old 1930s movie and should be seeing the scene
in black and white. Recently, superficial signs of progress have taken
hold: the health field in the United States boasts about the
increasing adoption of electronic records--particularly
<a href="http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/onc-data-brief-7-december-2012.pdf">since
the roll-out of Meaningful Use incentives in 2009</a>. But don't jump
to conclusions about the capabilities of new electronic systems: many
are harder to use than the paper records they replace, and barely more
useful.

</p>

<p>

In the United States, virtually every doctor uses electronic records
and exchange for billing, because money is the lifeblood of both the
health practices and the payers. But other activities, even something
as basic as ordering a prescription from a pharmacy is done manually.

</p>

<p>

When clinical patient records do get digitized, they remain what one
doctor called an "electronic file cabinet," separate from all the work
of planning and executing care. This article will refer to such
documents as an electronic health record (or EHR), because that term
is so common, but we must really think of patient records as a
critical component of an entire health system that involves a sequence
of events with each patient, along with analytics that set the
direction of whole collections of clinics and hospitals. And one
question running through this article is how the EHR can be used more
effectively throughout the operation of health institutions in what
reformers like to call
a <a href="http://iom.edu/Reports/2012/Best-Care-at-Lower-Cost-The-Path-to-Continuously-Learning-Health-Care-in-America.aspx"><em>learning
health care system</em></a>.

</p>

<p>

The potential advantages of electronic records start with various
levels of clinical decision support. Doctors can't independently keep
in their prefrontal cortexes all the information they need to suggest
accurate diagnoses and treatments--even the doctors (grudgingly) admit
that, which is why specialists and consultations exist. How can
electronic records augment clinicians' intelligence?

</p>

<ul>

<li>

At the most basic level, record systems emit alerts to warn doctors of
entries that are inconsistent with the data in the records, such as
when a patient has an allergy to a medication or the dose seems
excessive. Other alerts get thrown at nursing staff constantly from
cardiac monitors, intravenous delivery devices, and other equipment
attached to patients. The downside of this automation is alert
fatigue, caused by the system blindly reporting every possible
downside to using a medication.

</li>

<li>

Electronic records can also suggest diagnostic codes and appropriate
drugs in response to data entered.

</li>

<li>

The cutting edge of computer support can be seen in experimental
software that generates diagnoses when fed patient histories. Such
"expert systems" were tried in medicine as far back as the 1908s, but
were not powerful enough to be successful. Still, with the enormous
speed-up in computing and the rebirth of artificial intelligence in
the twenty-first century, researchers
are <a href="http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2013/02/12/the-computer-that-could-replace-your-doctor/">trying
again</a> to see whether the doctor can be rendered superfluous. IBM's
Watson, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/ibm-forms-watson-business-group-will-commercialization-follow-7000024929/">which
they started to commercialize in January 2014</a>, famously proved
that natural language analysis can bring to the surface multiple
plausible diagnoses for doctors to choose from. But we should
take <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/10/doctors-or-algorithms/">predictions
about the obsolescence of the doctor</a> with a grain of salt.

</li>

<li>

A digital health system can help the staff intervene with patients,
through such simple measures as reminding them to schedule and come to
follow-up visits. These sorts of interventions can reduce the risk of
hospitalization among high-risk patients, such
<a href="http://www.fiercehealthit.com/story/tech-helps-control-diabetes-western-new-york-beacon-community/2013-12-12">those
suffering from diabetes</a>. This is a clear example of technology
that supports, instead of interfering with, the relationship between
clinician and patient.

</li>
<li>

Records can flag patients at high risk, telling staff where to
concentrate their attention.

</li>

<li>

A patient web portal can allow clients to make appointments, check
results of tests, check for errors in diagnoses or medication lists,
and communicate with the staff for non-urgent questions. This is the
simplest and most obvious application of digital technology in an age
when most people can schedule car repairs and hotel reservations
online, but it's surprising how few clinicians allow such basic online
interaction.

</li>

<li>

Analysis of large data sets can turn up problems that help agencies
improve public health. They can also reduce costs by helping hospitals
identify and prioritize high-risk patients (a process called patient
stratification). They also allow payers to define
<a href="http://www.ncsl.org/portals/1/documents/health/EPISODE_of_CARE-2010.pdf">"episodes
of care"</a> that supposedly encompass all the treatment a patient
needed for a particular problem. This in turn lets payers define how
much the health providers should be reimbursed for treating various
patients with the same condition.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Some large institutions--notably the Department of Veterans Affairs,
with its famous VistA software, and Kaiser Permanente--have
historically created well-integrated health systems that support
sophisticated interventions to improve patient health. This requires a
long-term process, integrating all their hospital systems around the
records and training all their clinicians to take advantage of the
data they track. The institutions that do this have taken on a
comprehensive role in the patient's lives, being responsible for
insuring them as well as treating them. They represent the kind of
all-encompassing, cradle-to-grave coverage that many developed
countries do at a national level, and that we will look
at <a href="#aco_integrated">under the topic of accountable care
organizations</a>. According to one account, Kaiser
Permanente's <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/the-industry-standard/how-kaiser-bet-4-billion-electronic-health-records-and-won-217731">four
billion dollar expenditure on electronic health records</a> paid off.

</p>

<p>

Most deployments of electronic health records achieve considerably
less than the best sites do, however. EHRs follow an old 1980s model
of software development:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

They are entirely proprietary, although standards (which we'll look at
shortly) have been superimposed and allow limited data sharing.

</li>

<li>

Most predate the Web or use old technologies such as MUMPS
(standardized as the M language) that don't mesh well with the
Web. This leads to kludgy and limited work-arounds just so that EHRs
can meet such basic expectations as patient portals and, access by
clinicians on mobile devices. More recent entrants in the EHR space,
such as <a href="http://www.athenahealth.com/">Athenahealth</a>
and <a href="http://www.practicefusion.com">Practice Fusion</a>, have
chosen to go all-online (Software as a Service, or SaaS), providing
web-based records. They tend to be popular among physicians.

</li>

<li>

Not being standards-based, the software is expensive to develop,
install, and maintain. EHRs' market is therefore large institutions
with millions of dollars to spend on licenses and millions more on
implementation. Until recently, they have totally bypassed the small
community and rural providers where digital records could tremendously
improve care.

</li>

<li>

Records are developed to meet the interests of the hospital and clinic
administrators who make out the purchase orders, not the clinicians
who ultimately have to use the record system. Designed as they are for
administrators rather than clinicians, the EHRs' chief purpose is
billing rather than treatment. Some of the "clinical decision support"
built-in to these systems actually tells doctors how to find the codes
that legally maximize the payment for a given course of treatment (a
trick called up-coding).

</li>

<li>

Although digitization has transformed other industries, such as
e-commerce and finance, by making data exchange possible, the long
proprietary history of EHRs leaves them stubbornly resistant to
interoperability. The standards in this area have improved recently,
as we'll see later in the article. But currently, it is hard even for
a patient to obtain his or her own records--a right enshrined in law
through HIPAA.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Given the high prices associated with electronic records, they were
adopted only by large organizations up until the passage of
the <a href="http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/hitech-act">HITECH
act</a>, part of the 2008 economic recovery act. The incentives in
HITECH <a href="http://dashboard.healthit.gov/HITAdoption/">spurred
adoption</a>. But improvements in quality through electronic records
are more elusive. Some studies show clear improvements, such as
in <a href=" http://jamia.bmj.com/content/19/3/360.full">medication
prescription</a>,
while <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK37988/">other
studies are more cautionary</a>.

</p>

<p>

Institutions that adopt EHRs soon find themselves locked in, and when
those EHRs are ill-suited to modern habits (such as mobile access) or
new needs such as data sharing, the institutions find it hard to
change. So there's a big risk that EHRs promising Meaningful Use will
fail to meet the new requirements during the day-to-day knocking about
they receive (even if they are certified as Meaningful Use compliant),
and that the thousands of new health practices adopting the EHRs will
join their fellow prisoners among earlier adopters.

</p>

<p>

Errors can also be introduced by electronic records, as many
of <a href="http://cci.drexel.edu/faculty/ssilverstein/cases/">stories
attest</a>. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a major
<a href="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2011/Health-IT-and-Patient-Safety-Building-Safer-Systems-for-Better-Care.aspx">report
warning about safety problems in November 2011, the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality prepared
a <a href="http://healthit.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/citation/HealthITHazardManagerFinalReport.pdf">report
on tracking and assessing risks in electronic health systems</a> in
May 2012 (a summary of risks appears on page 29), and the Office of
the National Coordinator (which is responsible for administering the
government's electronic health record program) released
<a href="http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/safer">extensive
safety guidelines in January 2014</a>.  Besides plain and simple
bugs--for which the vendor denies liability--problems include:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Confusing interfaces that make it seem some information was recorded
when it was not, or the reverse.

</li>

<li>

Records that allow similar information in two or more places, thus
creating such risks as duplicate dosages. This can certainly happen
with paper records too, but electronic records hide the duplication
better and staff are less likely to know that duplicate locations
exist.

</li>

<li>

Information that is hard to see, perhaps simply because it is outside
the visible part of the page and the clinician forgets to scroll the
screen.

</li>

<li>

Images that are distorted or have text overlaid in the wrong places.

</li>

<li>

Unauthorized sharing of patient data.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Errors in electronic records also tend to propagate. In such cases,
one of the traits that makes them most valuable--data sharing--turns
into a vulnerability. And a data breach with EHRs can put millions of
patients at risk in one fell swoop, as front-page news reports also
remind us regularly. Some doctors would like the FDA to regulate
electronic records in hospitals somewhat as it regulates clinical
trials, claiming that increased costs are worth the problems that
would be averted.

</p>

<p>

Pathways toward improving electronic records include:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

Better attention to safety

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Electronic record systems definitely improve safety in some ways--such
as eliminating confusion in handwritten notes, and displaying warnings
about adverse drug reactions--but introduce other sources of error,
such as choosing the drug that appears on a pull-down menu next to the
one that was meant to be selected.

</p>

<p>

EHR vendors contractually deny responsibility for errors entered into
records through bugs or confusing interfaces. The clinician, who is
presumably able to check for and catch any errors, bears liability for
anything that goes wrong with a patient. To be fair, throughout the
computer industry, software manufacturers commonly assert no warranty
for software bugs.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Better user interfaces

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Electronic health records are among the most notorious pieces of
software to use. As mentioned earlier, the people making purchase
decisions are in administration. The dissatisfaction that doctors
express about their record systems
is <a href="http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/news/physician-outcry-ehr-functionality-cost-will-shake-health-information-technol">well
known</a>. Some of the difficulties come from clinicians that are not
used to computers (yes, quite a lot of them are in the field), from
the urgency and chaos endemic to many medical environments, or to
resistance of staff to give up poor workflows. But sometimes the
record system imposes its own rigid workflow without just cause.

</p>

<p>

Like industrial accidents and airplane crashes, medical errors
generally emerge from complex interactions of many factors such as
haste, misreported symptoms, and plain bad luck, where one factor may
be an EHR that gets in the way, hides information behind multiple
clicks, or has a garbled display.

</p>

<p>

Too often, EHR vendors do not understand what the physician needs to
see and do not respect the value of her time. For instance,
instructions that were added by a clinician to the software are
printed out as part of the record, probably by a programmer who
couldn't tell the difference between instructions and patient
information. Such awkward interfaces drain precious time from the
physicians' day, reducing the time they can spend with patients and
contributing to the serious shortage of physicians that threatens the
hope for universal health care in the US.

</p>

<p>

The reporting requirements that the government and insurers add,
potentially a boon for patient care and public health, create more
work that is often redundant. For instance, stage 1 of Meaningful Use
requires the doctor to report whether she checked the hemoglobin A1c
of each diabetic patient. The information that the patient has
diabetes and that the lab ran a hemoglobin test is in the record, but
the EHR doesn't take over the work of reporting it, requiring the
doctor instead to explicitly report it. Such EHRs should not be
certified as Meaningful Use compliant, but the certification
authorities don't care any more than the EHR vendor whether the
doctor's work in negatively impacted. No
wonder <a href="http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2014/01/23/Doctors-spend-third-of-time-with-patients-looking-at-computer/UPI-79101390532163/">doctors
</a>
spend third of time with patients looking at computer</a>, imperiling
their relationships with the patients (as we will see later, the core
of medicine is the relationship).

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Easier customization

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Even though every health institution is unique and making adaptations
to electronic records is critical, the record systems offer very few
customizations (for instance, they generally allow the doctors to
choose which medications appear on a list of treatments for a
particular condition, and which alerts pop up). Serious changes
require an investment in certified consultants or extra contracted
work with the vendor, and enhancements take place on the vendor's
schedule. A common complaint among doctors is that new EHR vendors act
responsive and agile with their first customers, and then turn just as
blank and bureaucratic as all the older vendors when success and
growth come. When local sites do make customizations, they my be swept
away by the next software upgrade.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

More transparency

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

</p>

Contracts and vendor responsibilities could be much more balanced and
reasonable, as
<a href="http://jamia.bmj.com/site/icons/amiajnl8946.pdf">recommended
by the American Medical Informatics Association</a>. This includes
rights of software users as basic as discussing costs of products and
defects.

</dd>

</ul>

<p>

The designers of the HITECH act were well aware that adoption of a
technology does not guarantee effective exploitation of the
technology's benefits; that's why their reimbursement program was
labeled Meaningful Use in a top-down attempt to improve the way
physicians use records.

</p>

<p>

Many problems of EHRs are solved at lower cost through free
software. Some of the free software or open source EHRs include
<a href="http://openmrs.org/">OpenMRS</a>, <a href="http://www.openehr.org/">OpenEHR</a>,
<a href="http://home.tolvenhealth.com/">Tolven</a>, <a href="http://oscarcanada.org/">OSCAR,
and several variants of VistA, whose development is now coordinated by
a foundation called <a href="http://www.osehra.org/">OSEHRA</a>.
VistA
is <a href="http://www.openhealthnews.com/hotnews/vista-rivals-epic-and-cerner-major-deployments-ehr-systems">gaining
a bigger installed base</a>, although its penetration is nowhere near
what its fame would seem to deserve. Deployments of open source health
records in developing nations
are <a href="http://www.pih.org/blog/university-hospitals-open-source-emr-a-model-for-evidence-based-health-care">supported
by Partners in Health</a>, among others.

</p>

<p>

The low adoption rate for these open source alternatives (at least in
the United States) has been blamed on disparate issues ranging from
sheer prejudice in the health care field to poor marketing. Certainly,
many of this open source software has academic or government origins,
and therefore aren't backed by strong sales organizations. VistA's
dependency on MUMPS also dissuades enough potential developers that
MUMPS wrappers have been created for other languages. But it also may
be that an EHR that truly makes life easy for clinicians has yet to be
created.

</p>

<a name="open_data">
<h3>Open data</h3>
</a>

<p>

Every year, the US Department of Health and Human Services holds a
large national forum dubbed the Health Datapalooza by Todd Park,
former Department CTO. The forum highlights new data sets released by
HHS and provides opportunities for activists as well as potential
entrepreneurs to talk to HHS and each other about good uses to which
they can put the data. It becomes a platform on which states can
target high-risk areas, web sites can help patients choose health care
providers, and other unanticipated value can arise.

</p>

<p>

HHS was not only one of the first institutions in the United States to
offer open health data, but one of the first US agencies to join the
open data movement, launching
an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/open">open data gold rush on the
federal level</a>. Other countries offering health data
include <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jan/24/sharing-nhs-medical-records-healthcare">the
United Kingdom</a>
and <a href="http://www2.datasus.gov.br/DATASUS/index.php?area=02">Brazil</a>.

</p>

<p>

Public agencies gather huge amounts of valuable data, but the release
of their data may lag months behind the events they track. This can be
blamed on the great efforts it takes to curate and clean that data,
but also to bureaucracy, budgetary constraints, or persistent workflows
based on pre-Internet ways of sharing data.

</p>

<p>

Sometimes it may be hard to figure out what we can learn from the
particular data being collected and released by governments. But
researchers from astronomers to military strategists have often had to
draw on their cleverness to draw the insights they need from the data
they can get. One example in health care is
the <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2013/06/moving-to-the-open-health-care-graph.html">use
of data on referrals to infer the quality of doctors</a>.

</p>

<p>

The practice of releasing large data sets on patients illustrates the
potential of integrated care--along with the risks to patient
privacy. Public data sets may hold the secrets to improved medical
care, but they are problematic from a privacy standpoint because it's
becoming easier and easier to identify patients who are supposed be
anonymous. Researcher Latanya Sweeney, who famously reidentified
Massachusetts Governor William Weld from publicly available data,
pulled off a similar feat in
2013 <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-06-05/states-hospital-data-for-sale-leaves-veteran-s-privacy-at-risk">using
data from the state of Washington state</a>. Data providers can
improve their anonymization techniques, but they are fighting a
constant battle against sophisticated data mining algorithms and the
increasing availability of data sets on ordinary people.

</p>

<p>

So anonymization is hard to manage, but so are more basic technical
issues. Organizations tend to collect data in self-contained databases
and even spreadsheets. Although they could put up those spreadsheets
and force users to download and disassemble them, friendlier data sets
are converted to an entirely different format that allows simple
programmatic access through a RESTful API. Creating and maintaining
data in this format takes a big investment. It can't be done just
once--new data must be incorporated quickly and accurately as it comes
into the organization.

</p>

<a name="clinical_research">
<h3>Reframing clinical research</h3>
</a>

<p>

Big pharma is in trouble. Household names--Pfizer, Merck, Eli Lilly,
Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb--that have historically been able
lavish billions of dollars on advertising, wooing doctors, sponsoring
conferences, and lobbying officials are reaching the end of flush
times. They have apparently already invented all the easy drugs that
treat large numbers of people for common ailments, so they now need to
invest increasing sums to find more elusive compounds serving smaller
populations.

</p>

<p>

Compounding their distress is the
<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-11-14/2014-outlook-big-pharma-drugs-going-off-patent">expiration
of patents that use to allow them to charge high prices</a> through an
effective monopoly on popular medications, and ever stricter
requirements for clinical
trials, <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2805%2967712-4/fulltext">imposed
by the FDA after disturbing safety lapses such the Vioxx case</a>.
For a number of reasons--some pertaining to FDA funding, but others
springing from the difficulties of developing safe and effective drugs--<a href="http://www.sci-tech-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=023001ATK5PN">the FDA is approving many fewer drugs than in the early 1990s</a>.
Finally, researchers are having so much trouble getting patients to
sign up for trials that the lack of subjects is the reason behind the
failure of
<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/doctors-too-few-cancer-patients-154156014.html">40% of cancer trials that don't run to completion</a>.

</p>

<p>

Biotech hasn't produced a game-changing breakthrough that will unjam
pharmaceutical research, so companies are starting to look with a
newly creative eye at clinical research. Innovations include:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Looking for new incentives and means of outreach to increase the pool
of patients willing to undergo trials.

</li>

<li>

Giving patients more of a say in the conduct of trials. Cracks are
appearing in the research ivory tower
through <a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2014/02/crowdsourcing-develop-clinical-trials.html">crowdsourcing
suggestions</a> such as submitting drafts for clinical trials for
public scrutiny, and even letting patients suggest trials.

</li>

<li>

Expanding cooperation around research that they call
"pre-competitive."

</li>

<li>

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/larryhusten/2014/01/30/johnson-johnson-will-share-clinical-trial-data/">Releasing
data from clinical trials</a>, notably those trials that produce
negative results most drug companies would rather not make public.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

These all aim at a less top-down, more collaborative development
process. A whole class of games such
as <a href="http://eterna.cmu.edu/web/">Eterna</a> engage the curious
public to solve problems in genetics, while crowdsourcing sites such
as href="http://folding.stanford.edu/">Folding@home</a> just ask for
our space computer cycles,
like <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI@Home</a>
famously does for astronomy.

</p>

<p>

Collaborative research requires data sharing, which in turn
requires some agreement on formats and categorization of data.
<a href="http://sagebase.org/about-2/">Sage Bionetworks</a> is one of
the organizations promoting
collaboration. A <a href="http://www.openhealthnews.com/resources/health-it-category/genomics-genetic-medicine">wide
range of repositories</a>, such
as <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">the Cancer Genome Atlas</a>,
offer fodder for researchers.

</p>

<p>

Data sharing can be a career-limiting move. For pharma companies, the
risk is that someone will build a patentable compound on top of their
research and steal their market. For researchers in the lab, the risk
is having someone else publish first (rival researchers have been
known to win or lose publication races by a few days). Perhaps the
health field needs to broaden its range of awards, so that a patent or
published paper is not the gold standard for advancing sales or
careers.

</p>

<p>

Meanwhile, a lot people have decided not to wait for clinical trials,
because they cost millions and can't be rolled out for everything that
interests patients. Their results often don't even apply to most
patients, because the subjects of trials must be "ideal" patients who
are healthy except for the condition the drug is meant to treat. Some
patients are engaging in citizen science to host clinical trials or
looser frameworks for discovering new cures. Patients also come
together into organizations such
as <a href="http://www.patientslikeme.com/">PatientsLikeMe</a>
and <a href="https://www.23andme.com">23andMe</a> (which has had to
suspend health-related activities after a dispute with the FDA over
claims made for them) to upload their personal information for data
mining that
can <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v29/n5/full/nbt.1837.html">turn
up trends long before clinical researchers could establish them
formally</a>. These health sites are turbo-charged and data-driven
upgrades to the forums that patients spontaneously form on social
networks, and represent a digital form of
disease-specific <a href="http://www.geneticalliance.org/">patient
alliances</a>.

</p>

<p>

Controversy exists over the collection of data from patients, even
when it's voluntary, because this data tends to be used for market
research and other activities patients might not support. Because the
money spent to develop mobile are cannot be recouped through sales,
and because HIPAA does not cover the apps (having been passed before
the category existed), many
developers <a href="http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/January/15/checking-your-blood-pressure-you-can-sell-your-personal-information.aspx">collect
and resell data from users</a>. Patients also harbor quite reasonable
fears, discussed under <a href="#open_data">the section on open
data</a>, that a life insurance company, employer, or identity thief
could deidentify the data and use it against the patient.
<a href="http://patientprivacyrights.org/2005/02/testimony-of-dr-alan-f-westin-professor-of-public-law-government-emeritus-columbia-university-and-director-of-the-program-on-information-technology-health-records-and-privacy/">Widely
cited research by law professor Alan Westin</a> shows that consumers
worry about the safety of their patient data and want a say in where
their data goes.

</p>

<p>

It would be too cumbersome to make researchers return to all their
research subjects to ask permission for every new use of data, but
some method is needed to let patients grant permissions for certain
kinds of research they support. Most patients do want their data used
to improve health outcomes. The debate over patient data parallels
that being conducted about the use of patient tissues and other
physical samples. There are no clear answers, but only trade-offs to
choose among.

</p>

<a name="ehr_barrier">
<h3>Barriers to using data</h3>
</a>

<p>

Barriers to reaping the benefits of data analysis include:

</p>

<dt>

Patient variability

</dt>

<dd>

The intractable individuality of patients doomed early expert
systems. Nobody is a pure specimen of any single condition; everyone
has complicating factors that require subtle weighings of
possibilities. so no simple field can capture every nuance of patient
behavior. For instance, a field in an electronic system indicating
tobacco use would not reflect that a patient smoked for ten years and
then quit. Diseases and conditions also interact in complex ways: for
instance, knee injuries are related to obesity. Complex histories are
hard to record: for instance, a check-box indicating whether or not a
patient smokes can't indicate whether he smoked for thirty years and
but successfully gave it up. Furthermore, the computer systems can't
take into account that patients and doctors differ in their abilities
to obtain, adhere to, pay for, and deliver treatments.

</dd>

<dt>

Unstructured data

</dt>

<dd>

Due partly to patient variability and partly to clinicians' habits, a
lot of useful data enters the record as free-form text. Natural
language processing has been used to evaluate these records, but it's
an inexact science. For instance, one can easily pick out the words
"cocaine use," but miss that the phrase occurred in the context,
"cocaine use proven not to be a factor." Furthermore, even if doctors
enter data into structured fields, the EHR software may provide
several different fields that could plausibly store the data, so the
same information for different patients may be in different places in
the record.

</dd>

<dt>

Alert fatigue

</dt>

<dd>

EHRs and hospital devices are programmed to react crudely to triggers,
and the manufacturers have set the triggers to be extremely sensitive
because they are so afraid of missing something important. The result
is that a doctor cannot get through a write-up of a routine visit
without clicking on innumerable dialog boxes to make them go away, and
hospital wards are as noisy as tropical forests with the sound of
beeps instead of animal calls. Although EHRs theoretically allow
doctors to customize the alerts that appear, no one has yet created a
truly intelligent alert system with acceptable levels both of false
negatives (which should be zero) and false positives.

</dd>

<dt>

Cost

</dt>

<dd>

Good equipment for telehealth can be expensive. Bandwidth for video
hook-ups, for instance, is not universally available. And although an
image may be sent to a clinician's cell phone, the phone's screen
probably lacks sufficient resolution to show the necessary detail.

</dd>

</dl>

<p>

A feasible solution to the patient record problem would involve:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

Free software

</dt>

<dd>

A powerful open source EHR, widely adopted, would permit rapid
innovation as new medical discoveries reveal the need for new data
fields and interactions. Many projects larger than an EHR have been
developed using free software methods, including Linux. It is
noteworthy that
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/google-and-samsung-soar-into-list-of-top-10-linux-contributors/">most
Linux development is now contributed by large corporations</a>--Intel,
IBM, Red Hat, Google, Samsung, and even Microsoft--who understand that
investments in a robust, free software code base are paid back
manyfold by other business opportunities. Hospitals and governments
have even greater incentives to support open source in health.

</dd>

<dt>

Application programming interfaces (APIs)

<dd>

Modern computing treats data sources as platforms on which other
people can build applications. A standard interface allows innovators
to flock to the underlying platform and make it richer and more
effective through add-on software. RESTful APIs are the most popular
interfaces right now, and are supported by powerful libraries in
nearly every programming language.

</dd>

<dt>

Intense clinician involvement in design

</dt>

<dd>

The people using the interface must be part of the design team
throughout the project, not just serving as external consultants
brought in for questions. And interfaces must be easier to
change. Some people say that the success of VistA sprang from its
genesis among doctors and nurses at the Department of Veterans
Affairs, who did much of their own coding.

</dd>

<dt>

Analytics

</dt>

<dd>

Electronic records need to be useful if we expect them to be
used. Their value comes from the information about patients and
institutions that can be extracted through data analysis. Currently,
"big data" (a convenient catch-all phrase for the enhanced statistical
techniques now being used to explore correlations among large and
often relatively unstructured data sets) is entering health care
through numerous small companies wielding mind-numbing analytical
expertise. But until basic analyses become cheap and universal,
records in most institutions will still have their secrets locked up
inside.

</dd>

<dt>

Patient control

</dt>

<dd>

No one benefits as much as the patient from the convenience and
predictive power of electronic records. As we'll see, patient control
is not only feasible but a key to aiding research.

</dd>

</dl>

<p>

Standards for entering diseases and patient conditions also complicate
clinical data entry, although the electronic systems are not to
blame. Both <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_main.html">SNOMED</a>
and
the <a href="http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf">ICD
series</a> are used to represent disease, but most billing in the
United States requires ICD. Although the latest version, ICD-10, was
finalized in 1990, and work on its successor ICD-11 is well underway,
US health organizations are still using the older ICD-9.

</p>

<p>

Based on assessments
that <a href="http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/ahima/bok1_036866.hcsp?dDocName=bok1_036866">ICD-10
will improve individual patient care, public health, and medical
research</a>, the government is now requiring a move to ICD-10 that is
<a href="http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/issues/22_2/Countdown-to-ICD-10-47180-1.html">straining
health organizations to a worrisome degree</a>. ICD-9 was already
fairly hard to traverse, at 18,000 codes, but ICD-10 increases this
number to 87,000 (see the Background section on
<a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/solutions-managing-your-practice/coding-billing-insurance/hipaahealth-insurance-portability-accountability-act/transaction-code-set-standards/icd10-code-set.page">this page</a>).
The American Medical Association seems to
see the requirement to use ICD-10 as a
<a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/washington/icd-10-letter-to-cms-12feb2014.pdf">distraction
that will detract from the investments that physicians need to make
to improve patient care</a>.

</p>

<p>

As mentioned earlier, patients are infinitely variable. Not only are
there many distinct medical conditions, but one condition will affect
another. The designers of the ICD standards understood this and made a
stab at representing relationships by extending the set. For instance,
ICD-10 code Ill covers "Hypertensive heart and kidney disease" as well
as "Hypertensive heart disease, w CHF." The standard also tries to
represent adverse effects of treatments through its T80 codes. But
this is a game that could go on forever. A hierarchical list of
individual codes can't possibly represent the complexity of
interactions between medical conditions.

</p>

<p>

A superior way to approach intersecting diseases may be for a standard
to represent diagnoses for individual diseases (at whatever level of
detail researchers find useful) but create links between diseases, so
that a doctor can indicate that one condition has caused, exacerbated,
or hidden another. The Semantic Web is an example of how this can be
done,
and <a href="https://dkm.fbk.eu/index.php/ICD-10_Ontology">ontologies
for ICD-10 already exist</a>. Of course, representing relationships
will still be a complicated task, and better tools for doctors and
coders can help.

</p>

<a name="coordinated_care">
<h2>Coordinated care: teams and telehealth</h2>
</a>

<p>

The new religion in the health care field urges us to see people not
as patients encountering the health care system through a set of
discrete visits, but as full humans needing lifetime care. Indeed,
this is the only way to treat chronic conditions, which are the health
concerns of affluent nations. (As countries increase wealth, their
health problems move more and more from acute conditions such as
infections to chronic conditions such as heart failure and diabetes, a
shift called an "epidemiological transition.") These are also called
"lifestyle" diseases. Now, there are plenty of chronic diseases that
can't be blamed on the life choices of the victims--such as asthma,
Crohn disease, or GERD--but still, these conditions do respond
strongly to individual choices and need to be managed in their daily
lives.

</p>

<p>

Therefore, researchers urge doctors to adopt a "systems perspective"
in medical care. Viewing a patient as a system that constantly
attempts to adapt to a changing environment can help a great deal in
the long-term planning required for today's chronic conditions. And
the patient's "system" is not only her body, but her mental attitude,
desires, and fears. Systems thinking also places a patient within a
family and a community, which is crucial to effecting change. Working
in an environment where lots of people smoke cigarettes, for instance,
not only exposes a person to second-hand smoke but weakens their
resolve to stay away from cigarettes.

</p>

<p>

Health care itself is also a system, naturally. And it helps not only
to view a clinic or hospital as a system, but to see the treatment
team that surrounds each patients as one. The doctor must integrate
tightly with other staff who deal with the patient--all the more
nowadays, given the doctor shortage, as care moves to nurse
practitioners. And the system must broaden to include the patient
herself.

</p>

<p>

Despite the increasing focus on chronic illness by health
professionals, acute diseases still require prompt attention, and the
risk of epidemics grows with the concentration of people into large
cities and their greater mobility.  Reports from individuals over
mobile networks, data analysis, and coordination among health
responders all help us deal with acute break-outs.

</p>

<p>

Telehealth--a term I'll use in preference to telemedicine, which
evokes a narrower range of activities--allows experts anywhere in the
world to weigh in on diagnosis. In many poor areas of the world
lacking doctors, a patient take a picture of a condition with a cell
phone and sends it to a doctor for evaluation. More commonly, a
patient or doctor contacts the expert over an Internet video
hook-up. The high end of telehealth is the remote monitoring of ICU
patients, which sounds sub-optimal but
can <a href="http://www.ihealthbeat.org/articles/2013/12/6/study-icu-telehealth-use-can-boost-survival-rates-speed-discharge">actually
do better by patients than depending on staff in the unit</a>. Social
networks among doctors, which allow them to share stories and ask for
expert advice, may also fall under the umbrella of telehealth.

</p>

<p>

Now we need to consider some of the mechanics behind IT in health. One
requirement looms behind nearly all the advances being
promoted--clinical research, patient empowerment, sensor data,
telehealth, and more: electronic data exchange. The health field needs
the same flexible, powerful data exchanged used by other organizations
all the time to carry out business and research
collaborations. <a href="http://www.hospitalemrandehr.com/2014/01/31/can-major-change-come-from-just-internal-hospital-data">There
is not much to learn from the data collected by any single
hospital</a>, so the institutions have to learn to create large,
combined data sets. They also need to incorporate the data streams
created by all the <a href="#device_sensor">consumer devices described
earlier</a>.

</p>
<p>

Without data exchange:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Sensors are mostly useless--they cannot forward their information to a
central storage point.

</li>

<li>

Clinical research is restricted to what a single lab can do on its
own. This limitation is throttling modern pharmaceutical companies and
academic researchers in biology, who have made all the easy
discoveries and are coming up with fewer and fewer products that pass
FDA scrutiny.

</li>

<li>

Patient engagement shrivels, because patients cannot learn what their
doctors know about them or share information among providers.

</li>

<li>

Telehealth is blind, and becomes essentially impossible.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

But the two technologies that permit electronic data exchange in most
fields are crippled in the health care field. Only in the past year or
two have breakthroughs been made, and they are far from being put in
place across providers:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

Formats

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

In digital media, the format defines how bits are laid out in a
document so someone can write a document on one side and someone else
can read it on the other. In electronic health records, HL7 never
provided a unified format; there were too many loopholes for putting
data in odd places or defining proprietary fields. Furthermore,
attempt to install a semi-modern convention, XML, was done by
translating a rather ill-structured older format into XML, leaving it
invalid and therefore hard to parse with standard XML tools.

</p>
<p>

The Consolidated-Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) in 2011
finally provided a more standard format supporting a wide range of
clinical documents, and it was adopted as a requirement for supporting
Meaningful Use, the government's program to promote adoption of
electronic health records. It is a complex format (taking up a
576-page draft specification) and still allows for proprietary
extensions, a concession that is probably necessary to promote
innovation.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Exchange protocols

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

In digital transmissions, protocols are the rules for opening and
closing connections, authenticating correspondents, and other
mechanisms needed to make a connection. The first standard protocol
defined in the health care
field, <a href="http://www.connectopensource.org">CONNECT</a>, began
as a government effort as late as 2008 and uses very heavy-weight
elements such as SAML
(see <a href="http://www.connectopensource.org/blog/2012-04-04-0000/how-did-we-implement-nationwide-health-information-network-specifications">the
CONNECT site</a>) or UDDI
(see <a href="http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/workshops/SOA-HC/presentations-10/13_E1_Riley.pdf">pages
12-13 of this PDF</a>).  Similarly complex and little-used SOAP
technologies <a href="http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=XDS.b_Implementation">underlie
the data exchange standard</a> used by institutions to share health records.

</p>

<p>

Now the government is pulling the health care
field behind two much more feasible
standards, <a href="http://wiki.directproject.org/">Direct</a> for
secure message exchange and
<a href="http://www.directtrust.org/">DirectTrust</a> for creating an
infrastructure that validates the users on each side of the exchange.
These do not guarantee, however, that doctors (and much less patients)
can exchange records,
because <a href="http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2014/02/01/teach-your-emr-to-do-email-impossible-maybe-not/">large organizations may block attempts at authentication</a>.

</p>

</dd>

</dl>

<p>

Current standards have by no means solved the data exchange problem.
The C-CDA is designed for the exchange of large documents, as the D in
its name suggests. But as people collect data from devices and send
them to doctors, they need protocols and formats appropriate for tiny,
frequent transmissions.

</p>

<a name="hie">
<h3>Health information exchanges</h3>
</a>

<p>

The Internet permits any two sites using the same protocol to exchange
data, a convenience we take advantage of hundreds of times a day. Why
shouldn't health data be exchanged just as easily? This is the goal of
health information exchange (HIE), a term referring both to the act of
sharing records and to certain institutions who exist solely to
facilitate that exchange.

</p>

<p>

The security of sensitive patient data is a concern here, and has
often been used as an excuse for refusing to use HIE. But security
shouldn't be any more of a problem than it is for financial
information or sensitive corporate secrets, which have often been
compromised but have still reached a point where most institutions
depend on digital exchange. Indeed, clinicians use the Internet all
the time for billing, the transmission of medical images, and other
communications; it's only treatment for patients that gets short
shrift.

</p>

<p>

HIE has historically been tied up with expensive organizations that
specialize in this area, which is like having to go to a special
online broker to place your book order at Amazon.com. Because doctors
had little incentive to give away the information they gathered about
a patient, these organizations usually lasted only as long as a state
agency,
the <a href="http://www.hospitalemrandehr.com/2014/01/29/nyc-health-systems-get-7m-to-share-data">US
government</a>, or some other outside funder was willing to pour
millions of dollars into them. HIEs depended on proprietary software
and offered no added value over a fax machine. Worst of all, they
violated patient trust by selling data, taking advantage of a loophole
in
HIPAA. <a href="http://ehrintelligence.com/2013/12/20/health-information-exchange-grew-by-leaps-and-bounds-in-2013/">Recent
efforts to rescue the concept</a> still don't show long-term
viability.

</p>

<p>

The very existence of HIEs was predicated on two problems: the
difficulty of translating documents between formats, and the
difficulty of matching patients. Each EHR vendor presented data in a
different format, as we have seen. So to serve hospitals
using <em>N</em> different vendors, an HIE would either
need <em>N</em><sup>2</sup> forms of translation software or develop
its own internal format along with code to translate it to and from
the format used by each vendor. Just to integrate systems within a
single institution, hospitals may pay specialized vendors tens of
millions of dollars to do what takes a few dozen lines of code and
some standard software libraries in other industries.

</p>

<p>

The United States, unlike many countries, has no unique, universal
identifier for residents. Although officially states are supposed to
implement the REAL ID act of 2005 in their ID cards, public fears over
identity theft and surveillance have kept the government from
enforcing the law. Therefore, clinicians and HIEs use up to 17
different identifiers (such as name, address, and age) to figure out
whether a patient seen by one hospital is currently at
another. A <href="http://www.ihe.net/technical_framework/upload/ihe_iti_suppl_pix_pdq_hl7v3_rev2-1_ti_2010-08-10.pdf">153-page
specification</a> defines the Patient Demographic Query and Patient
Identifier Cross-Reference standards that institutions use
to <a href="http://www.openempi.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2654507">ask
about the presence of patients and make the
match</a>. <a href="http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/blogs/what-hios-can-learn-from-the-onc-patient-matching-report-47152-1.html">Mistakes
often lead to loss of life.</a>

</p>
<p>

The US government is working on a voluntary identification system
call <a href="http://www.nist.gov/nstic/">Trusted Identities in
Cyberspace (NSTIC)</a>, based on certificates not much different from
those that validate web sites, but the system is far from ready.

</p>
<p>

All this groaning infrastructure has been put in place so doctors can
hoard data from their patients, exploiting it for marketing while
preventing other doctors from using it to improve care. Naturally, it
would be simpler just to leave data in patient hands. The patient
would just point a doctor to her online records before a visit. To
ward off those rare occasions when a patient is incoherent or
unconscious (fears raised constantly by professionals opposed to
patient control over data), patients could contain emergency phone
numbers for relatives or other agents to whom they have granted access
their records.

</p>
<p>

Two factors have led to slightly more success in the HIE area.

</p>

<ul>

<li>

The CONNECT and Direct protocols discussed
in <a href="#coordinated_care"> the section on data exchange</a>, once
they were supported by EHR vendors, allowed clinicians and HIEs to
dispense with some of the complicated translation software they
previously needed.

</li>

<li>

Some HIEs realize they must provide more value than simply shuttling
data between health care providers. These more forward-looking
organizations typically provide patient stratification to their
clients, using their knowledge of patient diagnoses to identify
at-risk patients. These are the key contributions of
the <a href="http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/beacon-community-program">Beacon
Communities</a> set up by the government as testbeds for modern,
coordinated care.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Yet despite these
advances, <a href="http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/hie-survey-offers-sobering-results-on-value-47151-1.html">few
HIEs are surviving</a>. It is time to remove them from the equation
and use standards such as Direct to enable data exchange between
doctor and patient, or between doctors under the control of the
patient.

</p>

<a name="aco_integrated">
<h3>Accountable care organizations and other integrated care</h3>
</a>

<p>

Most developed countries take responsibility for their entire
populations over long periods of time, and therefore have frameworks
that can handle (even if implemented imperfectly) integrated,
long-term treatments of chronic conditions. Such health systems exist
in the United States as well--the Department of Veterans Affairs and
Kaiser Permanente, mentioned earlier, and the Indian Health
Services--but most US residents have care provided episodically by
doctors and insurers that they may change without warning.

</p>

<p>

The payment and policy issues created by this situation lie beyond the
scope of this article, but we can certainly look at the IT that would
be required by an integrated health system.

</p>

<p>

Thus, the biggest upheaval in American health care in the 2010s decade
may be the attempt by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services
to reorganize hospitals and clinics into consortia with comprehensive
responsibility for patients'
health. Called <a href="www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ACO">accountable
care organizations</a>, it encourages clinics and hospitals to combine
and offer complete services to patients--in short, to act more like the
Department of Veterans Affairs.

</p>

<p>

CMS encourages ACOs to reduce costs through incentives that work
against the old toxic model of paying for each visit. Each patient in
a certain category (such as certain types of heart disease) is assumed
to cost a certain amount to treat. The ACO is rewarded for keeping
costs below this threshold. The plan is a step toward global payments,
which pay the health provider a fixed sum to take care of an entire
population.

</p>

<p>

Determining how much a particular patient should "cost" is a difficult
judgement that requires better data than we have now. Furthermore, the
three-year period for which an ACO is considered responsible for a
patient may not be long enough to see improvements in chronic
conditions. But the problems with ACOs go deeper.

</p>

<p>

Few ACOs have been set up yet. CMS presents early evidence that
<a href="http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/cms-medicare-medicaid-acos-are-saving-money-47194-1.html">ACOs
are saving money</a>, probably by picking off the low-hanging
fruit. (Without technological
razzle-dazzle, <a href="http://iom.edu/~/media/Files/Perspectives-Files/2013/Commentaries/VSRT-ValueBasedCare.pdf">Blue
Cross Blue Shield also announced significant cost savings from
value-based care</a>.) A successful ACO meets
the <a href="http://www.ihi.org/offerings/Initiatives/TripleAim/Pages/default.aspx">"triple
aim"</a> in health care--improving the patient experience, achieving
better health, and lowering costs--through such data-rich activities
as:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Tracking the patient from primary care to specialist to hospital to
physical therapist and so on, making sure the patient follows up on
recommended treatments.

</li>

<li>

Sharing a patient's records expeditiously among all the clinicians
working with the patient.

</li>

<li>

Crunching data about patient conditions and outcomes to find where
treatments failed to achieve the desired result.

</li>

<li>

Using this longitudinal data to predict trends, which helps them
apportion resources more efficiently and even contributes to public
health.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

In the best case, fixed payments and rigorously monitored
outcomes--both are necessary to make the ACO work--will inspire
providers to look for efficiencies.

</p>

<p>

Essentially, to be successful, an ACO has to exchange data seamlessly
as the patient moves through its system. One might think of ACOs as
bringing health information exchange within the boundaries of the
cooperating providers (or as trying to mitigate against the larger
goal of enabling health information exchange throughout the health
care system). As we have seen, current EHRs are not capable of that
seamless exchange. ACOs are also at constant risk because a patient
always has the right to get care from someone outside the ACO. They
need powerful incentives to keep each patient within their system.

</p>

<p>

So the problems faced by ACOs are best solved on a more global level;
each ACO lacks the wherewithal to solve it themselves. In particular:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Data exchange requires robust, easy-to-implement standards that should
be reached at a national or even international level. To glom together
many local hospitals and clinics into ACO and expect it to harmonize
their record systems is too much to ask. The problems of current ACOs
show
how <a href="http://ehrintelligence.com/2014/01/22/what-do-acos-reveal-about-the-importance-of-integration/">integration through data sharing is both critical and hard for them to achieve</a>.

</li>

<li>

Decision support and public health are facilitated by huge data
sets. The more institutions combine to exchange data, the more they
can learn. As we shall see, a national public health plan could be
built on data stored by patients shared at their discretion. Although
some individual hospitals have learned valuable lessons by tracking
their own data, and Kaiser Permanente has achieved a lot by exploiting
its huge scale, a national health system has far better data than the
amount an ACO can collect.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

The perennial complaint of health reformers has been the isolation of
data and decision making by individual doctors or institutions--data
silos, as they are called. ACOs just create bigger silos where
standards are needed instead. They also risk raising costs by creating
larger, more powerful players--a risk CMS is apparently willing to take
because of the chance they can lower costs through better
coordination. But I consider ACOs an experiment whose lessons can be
eventually applied in a national plan.

</p>

Because large collections of data make for more accurate statistical
analyses, interesting public health benefits are coming from
organizations that manage to get their hands of data from lots of
patients: services chosen by patients such as PatientsLikeMe and
Web-based EHRs. Because all patient data is stored in a centralized
location, these companies can look for trends. For instance, when the
2013 federal government shut-down forced the Centers for Disease
Control to stop tracking incidents of the flu,
<a href="http://www.athenahealth.com/blog/2013/10/04/athenaresearch-tracking-flu-activity-during-the-cdc-furlough/">Athenahealth
filled the gap</a>. However, as we'll see, privacy is better protected
if patients store data instead of either doctors or vendors.

<a name="telehealth">
<h3>Telehealth</h3>
</a>

<p>

This buzzword has been applied broadly to many aspects of health
care. Examples include:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Contacts by phone or text messages to remind patients of basic care,
such as coming to doctor's appointments or taking their medication.
<a href="https://app.preventnow.com/how_it_works">Prevent</a> goes
farther, linking people at risk for diabetes with coaches and other
participants over a mobile device. Rudimentary technologies can be
used in very sophisticated ways. For instance, recruiting a family
member to text a patient may produce a better outcome than receiving
an impersonal text message from the clinic.

</li>

<li>

Remote consultations. These may take place between a patient and a
doctor, or between a doctor and a specialist. Although the use of

video connections for mental health treatment were disparaged for a
long time, some patients find it helpful. One intense variant of the
remote consultation is
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18305328">remote intensive
care</a>. Intensive care units are laden with sensors, which can be
monitored by experts outside the center just as easily as by nurses on
the floor. Some studies suggest that remote ICU monitoring can save
money and catch problems that would be missed by busy nurses present
on the ICU.

</li>

<li>

Contacts with patients in their own
homes, <a href="#individual_home">discussed earlier</a>.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Remote medicine changes the health equation for people living in areas
underserved by doctors, such as rural areas and developing
nations. Ordinary residents of poor areas, even children, can be
taught to run apps on a phone that walk them through questions that
help determine what is wrong with a patient. They can also take photos
of afflicted areas of the body and send them to doctors in cities
better served by clinics. One example is a
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-25986841">modified mobile
phone</a> that can take pictures of the eye</a>.

</p>

<p>

Many applications of telemedicine simply extend the reach of a doctor,
not much different from placing a telephone call. The model of health
care remains the traditional one in these situations, albeit with some
convenience for the patient and cost savings. Truly transformative
telehealth involves a large set of the technologies we have examined
for collecting, exchanging, and analyzing data.

</p>

<a name="coordinated_care_barrier">
<h3>Barriers to coordinated care</h3>
</a>

<p>

The main barriers to data exchange are institutional decisions.
Hospital and clinic administrators know that making data portable will
ease the way for patients to find other providers, should they choose
to do so. ACOs are formed to preserve the same competitive advantages
while allowing care to improve. EHR vendors undermine interoperable
standards for the sake of their clients as well as to preserve
barriers to entry in their own markets. Pharmaceutical companies and
clinical researchers guard secrets to further their careers.

</p>

<p>

Payments models need to change drastically to accommodate
telehealth. Currently, most payers won't even reward a doctor for
using email or the telephone to advise a patient instead of requiring
a visit to the office. But <a
href="http://www.americantelemed.org/docs/default-source/policy/state-telemedicine-legislation-matrix.pdf">many
states are preparing legislation to allow telemedicine</a>, and a
<a
href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/new-bill-breaks-down-telehealth-barriers">simple
bill introduced into Congress</a> would promote consultations with
doctors over state lines. Because doctors are comfortable initiating
consultations and patients in underserved areas crave contact with
professionals, telehealth should become very popular once the
enabling factors are in place.

</p>

<p>

Many health practitioners also claim that regulations raise barriers
to useful data exchange. The heavy weight of regulation cannot be
denied: in the US we have the famous HIPAA law, augmented by hundreds
of pages of regulations that interpret it and that change every few
years, plus many state laws specifying dealing with health privacy.
But this is an area of much contentious debate, with many
sophisticated clinical and IT leaders saying that HIPAA does not have
to restrict useful data sharing and that it is simply misinterprete by
providers.

</p>

<p>

In fact, as we have seen, HIPAA has limited scope and fails to cover
important privacy gaps. For instance, its "safe harbor" method of
deidentifying patient data
is both <a href="http://www.privacyanalytics.ca/on-the-limits-of-the-hipaa-safe-harbor-de-identification-standard/">woefully
inadequate and unnecessarily restrictive</a>. On the positive
side, regulations were
recently updated to ensure that
<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/businessassociates.html">business
associate to whom health providers gave patient data had to comply
with the law</a>. Business associates are companies to which health
provider outsource things such as billing and analytics, and who
should not be taking advantage of the patient data given to them for
other purposes.

</p>

<p>

But even accounting for all those considerations, we also have to
acknowledge technical barriers to  health information exchange and
consequently to coordinated care.

</p>

<ul>

<li>

As explained under <a href="#ehr_barrier">barriers to decision
support</a>, people are inherently variable, so data exchange could be
comparing apples to oranges.

</li>

<li>

Data collected by researchers is just as variable as data from medical
records. One researcher will collect data under different temperatures
or other conditions from a researcher next door, or divide the data
into different categories.

</li>

<li>

Errors are rife in medical records. It has been estimated that
everybody's record has errors. These weaken the validity of
conclusions based on data processing. Luckily, statisticians and data
scientists have developed algorithms to compensate for suspicious data
fields.

</li>

<li>

As mentioned under <a href="#barrier_device">barriers to the use of
devices</a>, integrating information submitted by patients and their
devices has its own challenges.

</li>

<li>

There is no simple way, as discussed in
the <a href="#clinical_research">section on clinical research</a>, to
obtain flexible consent from patients for the use of their data.

</li>

</ul>

<a name="engagement_games">
<h2>Patient empowerment and health-enhancing games</h2>
</a>

<p>

Everything we've seen in health IT advances so far point to a bigger
role for individuals in their own health care. Health experts like to
talk about "patient engagement" or "patient satisfaction,"
condescending terms that suggest the doctor has all the answers but
needs to use a soft well to make stupid or recalcitrant patients
comply. Patient advocates prefer the term "patient empowerment" and
replay "compliance" with "adherence." The very term "patient," reeking
of passivity and helplessness, irks some advocates,
but <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2013/05/the-elusive-quest-to-transform-healthcare-through-patient-empowerment.html">other
terms such "consumer" have problems too</a>.

</p>

<p>

The psychological, organizational, and policy implications of patient
empowerment (or even engagement) are huge, but this article focuses on
the role of computing and data. How can health IT help move care to
its new locus, the individual? We have already
discussed <a href="#individual_home">patient-centered medical
homes</a>, <a href="#qs_selves">Quantified Self</a>,
and <a href="#clinical_research">openings in clinical_research</a>,
but similar changes can suffuse through many other areas of the health
care field.

</p>

<a name="without_doctor">
<h3>Health care without a doctor</h3>
</a>

<p>

Insensitive doctors sometimes act as if the patient was not a
factor. People are turning the tables now, engaging in many
health-related activities without involving clinicians. And today's
technology is replete with playthings and baubles for the motivated
individual--often acting in collaboration with peers. But they can
show real benefits.

</p>

<p>

For instance, a number of mobile
apps <a href="http://www.fiercehealthit.com/special-reports/7-health-technologies-veterans-mobile-apps">help
veterans manage stress and mood<a>, while several apps such
as <a href="http://stompstaging.telus-nas.com/FAQ.aspx">STOMP</a>
offer regular encouragement to tobacco smokers who want to quit.
Games improving brain performance are a particularly popular niche.
Sites such
as <a href="http://about.onehealth.com/howitworks/">OneHealth</a>
and <a href="http://www.proteus.com/todays-products/for-professionals/">Helius</a>
are broader and more strategic, setting up plans for patients to
follow in their daily lives.

</p>

<p>

People often use social networking sites with which they are already
familiar, such as Facebook, to form communities around health issues.
Others choose specialized sites, such as PatientsLikeMe. People can
even <a href="https://www.hulahq.com/">share test results with
potential sexual partners</a> to provide assurances they are free of
STDs.

</p>

<a name="gamification">
<h3>Gamification</h3>
</a>

<p>

One exciting area of health research is
the <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/06/games-for-health-covers-curren.html">use
of video games</a>. All types of games can be impressed into service
in the pursuit of better health: mental challenges, role-playing games
(sometimes for clinicians as well as patients), competitions, and even
the old stand-by, first person shooter games.

</p>

<p>

A game is an automated form of patient engagement, along the lines of
text messages reminding them to take their medication, but infinitely
more powerful. No one has to ask a patient to be engaged; with a game
he chooses to be so.

</p>

<p>

It may not be surprising that games can ameliorate mental conditions
such as Attention Deficit Disorder or Post-Traumatic Stress
Syndrome. Perhaps more thought-provoking is their role in helping
<a href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/candy-crush-stroke-patients">stroke
victims</a> and cancer patients recover. And
the <a href="http://rockhealth.com/2013/07/games-for-health-the-latest/">combination
of games and devices</a> creates a whole new playing field for medical
research. For some people, games outperform medications in every way,
proving in some conditions
to <a href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/gamification-secret-cutting-care-costs-mHealth-mobile">cheaper</a>,
more effective, less dangerous, longer-lasting in their effects--and
of course more fun.

</p>

<p>

Why do people love games? There are several possible explanations,
including the story-telling suggested by a game and the way it makes
people feel they're in control. The feeling of control is a bit odd,
because every detail presented to them on the screen--assuming it's a
video game--has been planned and programmed. In any case, games seem
the ultimate in putting the patient in control. Games also make
maximum use of feedback loops, which people use in all areas of life
(and health) to encourage positive thinking and behavior.

</p>

<p>

Many games are also social. One can compete with others for
achievements and at the same time feel spurred on by their support and
cameraderie to make behavior changes.

</p>

<a name="transparency">
<h3>Transparency</h3>
</a>

<p>

Economists and other observers of the health care industry understand
that it is not a market. Most wish it was a market--a level playing
field where patients knew the costs of care, the quality of the
provider, and all their options. But in the United States, all too
often:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Not even the provider knows how much a patient will pay until the
insurance company issues a statement, often after the procedure has
taken place. Prices are set in secret negotiations between providers
and insurers and vary among patients.

Hospitals conceal the rate of complications, rehospitalizations, and
deaths from procedures, and even though governments often collect such
information, they rarely publicize it so that patients can compare
doctors. Industry experts know quite well
that <a href="http://capsules.kaiserhealthnews.org/index.php/2014/01/expensive-hospitals-strong-reputations-but-little-evidence-of-better-care-study-finds/">reputation
is a poor guide to actual quality</a>. To top off the problem, patient
ratings are mostly irrelevant, being based more on the quality of the
food or the amount of noise in the corridor (not that these are
unimportant) than the success or failure of procedures.

</li>

<li>

Doctors try to present alternative treatments (including the
alternative of no treatment) to patients, but it's hard to predict the
relative success of each treatment. Genetic analysis in some cases can
indicate what will work for a particular patient. Many new treatments
come along that doctors aren't aware of. The success rate of more
experimental treatments may be unknown.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Governments have started
<a href="https://data.medicare.gov/Nursing-Home-Compare/Quality-Measures-Short-Stay/u8my-ac5x">releasing
data about hospital quality</a>, and some intrepid sites such
as <a href="http://clearhealthcosts.com/">Clear Health Costs</a> use
public data sets and crowdsourcing to build support for patients
trying to compare costs. Some observers worry that making prices
public will actually lead some facilities to raise prices. But when
the day comes that everyone can see the price and outcome of popular
procedures, the market will take over and crush institutions that are
providing bad care or overcharging.

<h3>Patient control over data</h3>
</a>

<p>

What have seen in our tour through modern health care in this article?
That patients can benefit from the output of sensors and monitoring,
which is by definition their own data. That electronic records are the
basis of better care, but that they're most secure and available when
the patient has control over them. When you think about it, patient
empowerment is meaningless without patient control over data.

</p>

<p>

As mentioned earlier, doctors routinely ignore the legal requirement
to show patients their health
records. The <a href="http://www.myopennotes.org/what-is-opennotes-2/">OpenNotes</a>
advocacy organization
found <a href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1363511">several
advantages to providing simple patient portals</a>, such as patients
taking their prescribed medications more often. But a patient portal
is still not as empowering as records that patients maintain
themselves.

</p>

<p>

Two major projects have offered patients a place to keep their own
health records: Google Health and
<a href="https://www.healthvault.com/">Microsoft
HealthVault</a>. Google closed its service because it wasn't taking
off, and adopters of HealthVault are also fairly sparse. Many
explanations for these lackluster results have circulated, some based
on the services' difficulty of use or lack of features, others based
on the resistance put up by doctors. In any case, it's clear something
big has to change
to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gpk-fbfg4Y">give patients
their damn data (video)</a>.

</p>

<p>

One feature of the winning electronic health system is sure to be free
software, which already offers several promising developments:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

<a href="http://indivohealth.org/">Indivo</a> to store data

</dt>

<dd>

An inspiration for Google Health and an actual source of some of
HealthVault's source code, Indivo is a free software personal health
record. It
includes <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/06/clinician-researcher-and-patie.html">an
API to let other EHRs upload data to it</a>--but no simple way to
download data in bulk, because the developers' goal is leave data
under the patient's control.

</dd>

<dt>

<a href="http://www.healthit.gov/bluebutton">Blue Button</a> to
download data from EHRs

</dt>

<dd>

This project, the brainchild of the Department of Veterans Affairs,
has become a standard for the whole health industry. When Blue Button
started, the project was simplicity itself: a patient could press a
button on the health provider's web site and receive a down-and-dirty,
plain text list of his conditions, treatments, and other facts. A more
structured XML format has been developed to make the data friendly for
apps as well as human readers.

</dd>

<dt>

<a href="http://wiki.directproject.org/">Direct</a> for data exchange

</dt>

<dd>

Introduced in the <a href="#coordinated_care">data exchange section of
this article</a>, Direct makes secure exchange of patient data
possible even if both sides have nothing more sophisticated than
email. Because encrypted email is so rare, most users will have to
contract with a web site to protect the transmission, but they'll have
to use it anyway to authenticate the person with whom they want to
exchange data.

</dd>

</dl>

<p>

Health providers are gradually putting data in the cloud to reduce
costs, improve security, and make access easier, so there is no reason
the records shouldn't be under the control of the patient instead of
the provider. Smart cards, which have been used in France and other
countries for many years, may also work in tandem with personal health
records, making it
<a href="http://www.healthitoutcomes.com/doc/a-strong-case-for-smart-cards-in-healthcare-0001">easy for patients to bring their data to many health
providers</a>.

</p>

<p>

But even if someone weaves all these technologies into an appealing
and usable patient record, how can patients be encouraged to use the
records, and doctors encouraged to consult them? The key to progress
returns, perhaps, to the very first element of health reform listed in
this article: sensors worn by patients to preserve their observations
of daily living. Such data could grow in value to become
indispensable, whereupon doctors and their EHRs will have to open up
to patient-maintained records.

</p>

<p>

Several leading health IT groups have
<a href="http://mobihealthnews.com/27825/industry-groups-to-hhs-include-patient-generated-data-in-mu-stage-3/">asked
the Department of Health and Human Services</a> to require health
providers to accept patient data in Stage 3 of Meaningful Use.  But
because consumer devices also report their results to data silos
maintained by the device's vendor, the patient must also be able to
run a simple program to capture the data, either from the device or
from the vendor's site.

</p>

<p>

When patients insert data into records, encoding them with
a <em>provenance</em> becomes even more important. It's always
valuable to know how data was obtained, but doctors are particularly
cautious about measurements that were taken outside the clinical
setting.

</p>

<p>

Patients have <a href="http://reginaholliday.blogspot.com/">been
advocating for access to their records for many decades</a>, but
technology is finally emerging to back up their demands. This article
has hopefully suggested some of the significant advances that the
health care field can make when their demands are met.

</p>

<a name="closing">
<h2>General closing thoughts</h2>
</a>

<p>

It's no coincidence that President Obama--along with many other
presidents
from <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/3/399.full">Harry
Truman</a>
through <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~starr/20starr.html">Bill
Clinton</a>--made health care reform central to his administration.
Americans are facing multiple health crises, whether from the effects
of obesity or the tragedy of drug addiction. Health costs are
bankrupting the nation--when people talk about the federal deficit,
they are essentially referring to Medicare's expected payouts. And
Americans are just plain terrified by the prospect of getting sick and
not being able to get treatment.

</p>

<p>

And although the United States ranks far higher than other nations in
its health expenditures and far lower than other developed countries
in its health, the problems are not limited to this country. The
entire world is aging, while breakthroughs in treatments raise
expectations for care.

</p>

<p>

Conservative views among clinicians and hospital administrators are
understandable. People can get hurt if something goes wrong, and
decades of fail-safe practices to protect patients have been built up
that put a damper on experimentation. The consequences of a bug or
missed step are far greater than dropping an update to a social
network.

</p>

<p>

It is not within the scope of this article to discuss health care
policy. As for fears that the Affordable Care Act will raise costs,
I'll simply say--if you provide people with health insurance but don't
actually make them healthier, sure, costs will go up.

</p>

<p>

Thus, regardless of the fate of the ACA or of political controversies,
it is critical for societies to make use of available data. Patients
must get their data and must be encouraged to provide it to
researchers. Analytics must be made widely available and used
sensitively to reveal the places where health care can improve. The
improvements may be as simple as a reminder phone call, as
sophisticated as the identification of sick neighborhoods, or as
dazzling as the discovery of new miracle drugs. Technology and social
change will meld to create medical progress, regardless
of <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/02/04/veteran-vc-says-beware-of-health-it-bubble-not-enough-actual-business-plans/">any
hype or overinvestment that may be taking place in the early 2010
decade</a>.

</p>

<p>

People in high-tech like to lecture the health care field to adopt
more of a "Silican Valley mentality." While the meaning of that phrase
is vague, it usually suggests hackers making prototypes and rolling
out rapid updates, and being funded by open-handed venture capitalists
(except after bubbles burst). But in my view, these activities are not
the most important aspects of success in the Silicon Valley.
Furthermore, the modus operandi is not appropriate for health. In
health, the consequences of bug are not just a message informing a
visitor she cannot post a photo. It could mean that a patient is
missing urgent treatment, or being given too much radiation.

</p>

<p>

The true energy behind the "Silican Valley mentality" lies in the
inquisitive people who might nightly in basements, kitchens, and
hacker spaces all over the region to show what they've been doing
lately, discuss problems, and come up with solutions together. This is
not taking hold in health IT. User groups meet for various products,
but everyone overall--hospitals, researchers, EHR consultants--is
trying to preserve secrets and use other people's ignorance to their
competitive advantage. Only in hackathons can one find an open
attitude toward making progress. Until health IT experts form
communities to discuss what's bothering them and seek common ground,
there will be little of the Silicon Valley mentality in health
care--and little reform either.

</p>

<p>

In a health care field dominated by chronic illness, health lies in
the hands of each of us. But we can't get better unless we work
together. Sensors, data, electronic records, data sharing, and open
source software are all part of that collaboration.
