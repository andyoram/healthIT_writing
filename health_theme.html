A constellation of new health-related activities and technologies,
validated by clinical research and rolling out into medical practice,
holds the promise of better health for everyone. These activities
exploit the astonishing miniaturization of ever-more powerful devices,
along with the collection, analysis, and sharing of data, to support
better coordination and delivery of health care. Interest in these
innovations is driven by the health care system's pressing need to:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Control chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension to prevent
progression and complications

</li>

<li>

Find more effective and less intrusive treatments for a range of
diseases, and do so faster

</li>

<li>

Lower system-wide costs, or at least staunch the rate of increase

</li>

<li>

Reduce medical errors and misdiagnoses

</li>

<li>

Improve patients' sense of control over their care and their destiny

</li>

<li>

Ease stress on practitioners and caregivers

</li>

<li>

Sweep away some of the administrative and bureaucratic load

</li>

</ul>

</p>

<p>

What are the promises of the new technologies, and what conditions
have to be in place to enjoy those benefits? Why do some technologies
seem to languish despite their apparent advantages? How do all these
things depend on each other, and what technologies and activities need
to be adopted in tandem?

</p>
<p>

The large trends in these groundbreaking approaches--as well as the
things that stand in their way--form the subjects of this article. It
is not a catalog of applications or technologies, but a broad
investigation of their potential. I hope that the themes herein come
home to several types of diverse readers:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Anyone with a career in medicine and the enormous health care
industries will see big changes in the field. The health care
industries aren't likely to shrink dramatically or be disintermediated
as have travel agents, bookstores, many newspapers, or much of the
music recording industry, but some of their functions will disappear
while others leap into the twenty-first century. The technologies
discussed here will be implicated in these disruptions.

</li>

<li>

Computer experts, data scientists, and other hi-tech professionals
will <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/big-growth-forecast-health-it-market">stream
into health care</a>, where they will stumble upon very unusual
activities and norms.

</li>

<li>

Professionals in public health and health care policy will want to
understand the potential the technology holds to affect treatments and
costs, and to maintain a clear-sighted view of the problems that crop
up when applying the technologies. Problems are unknown or
underestimated by to some observers, while being shaken vigorously in our
faces by others to block the deployment of useful technologies.

</li>

<li>

People concerned about the economic future of nearly any country in
the world should worry about the exploding costs of health care. These
are being driven by aging populations as well as new diagnostic
techniques and treatments that provide astonishing advances in
extending human life, but at great expense, and are exacerbated by
inefficient business and clinical processes, lack of information
liquidity, and overlapping, sometimes contradictory regulatory
demands. Smart health technologies, including patient engagement,
could help those increases to level off.

</li>

<li>

Everybody will feel the shift. Your interactions with this new health
care system (and for the first time, we might really be able to
ennoble our grab-bag of medical practices and technologies by calling
them a "system") will differ depending on whether you are young or
old, live in a city or the country, are (currently) healthy or
chronically ill--but the interaction will be very different from what
most people have now.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

What are some of the technological changes coming over the horizon?

</p>

<img width="500" src="Black_Nike_FuelBand.jpeg" alt="Wearable device">

<p>

<em>Wearable device (source: Wikipedia)</em>

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Sensors are checking how elderly residents move around their homes,
and registering signs of inactivity that may indicate ill health or
atypical patterns suggesting disorientation.

</li>

<li>

Behavioral conditions are being treated with the help of games, some
of which produce lasting improvements such as promoting adaptation in
victims of PTSD, and instilling control in people with ADHD by
presenting tasks and then throwing distractions at the player.

</li>

<li>

Large-scale data analysis of patient reactions to marketed drugs are
turning up adverse effects not found during clinical trials, and
prompting reconsideration of the sterling trust placed in conventional
trials.

</li>

<li>

Electronic record exchange is allowing patients to walk into a
hospital hundreds of miles from where they have previously been
treated and offer unfamiliar doctors complete medical histories,
including key information such as drug allergies.

</li>

<li>

Mobile phones are allowing people in isolated rural areas, even in
developing nations, to snap photos of medical problems or even measure
vital signs and get advice from remote doctors.

</li>

<li>

Researchers are starting to release not only articles about their
research, but also the underlying data used to reach their
conclusions, allowing other researchers to check their work, duplicate
studies, and combine the data from multiple experiments.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Technology is always just a tool, whose use rises, falls, and
metamorphizes through its relation to the people and organizations
that use it. Technology also introduces risks whose effects in
medicine can weaken the doctor/patient relationship and cause
life-threatening errors. Although this article does not delve into
social policy or organizational change, I'll look at some of the
impacts these have on the technologies, and vice versa.

<p>

Health reformer Arien Malec delineated (in
a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEOF1hKp21c">video-taped
presentation</a>) the tension between technology and the personal
touch. In earlier ages of medicine we enjoyed a personal relationship
with a doctor who knew everything about us and our families--but who
couldn't actually do much for us for lack of effective treatments.
Beginning with the breakthroughs in manufacturing antibiotics and the
mass vaccination programs of the middle 20<sup>th</sup> century,
medicine has become increasingly effective but increasingly
impersonal. Now we have medicines and machinery that would awe earlier
generations, but we rarely develop the relationships that can help us
overcome chronic conditions.

</p>

<p>

Health IT can restore the balance, allowing us to make better use of
treatments while creating beneficial relationships. Ideally, health IT
would bring the collective intelligence of the entire medical industry
into the patient/clinician relationship and inform their
decisions--but would do so in such a natural way that both patient and
clinician would feel
like <a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2014/02/entering-exam-room-weight-computer.html">it
wasn't there</a>.

</p>

<p>

This article takes a tour through specific technologies, tools and
trends to see what has really been accomplished and what is feasible
in the near future:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

<a href="#device_sensor">Devices, sensors, and patient monitoring</a>

</dt>

<dd>

We start our journey with information technology that lies right next
to our bodies, and sometimes even inside them. This section discusses
how things we touch, hold, and wear, along how our concern for fitness
in daily life, can become part of formal health treatment.

</dd>

<dt>

<a href="#using_data">Using data: records, public data sets, and research</a>

</dt>

<dd>

The use of computers, including the devices from the previous section,
revolves around data. Here we turn to an area of information
technology that is somewhat hidden away but will prove absolutely
crucial to health care: understanding ourselves through data about
ourselves and our institutions. This must be collected, stored, sent
between health care sites, and used to find better treatments.

</dd>

<dt>

<a href="#coordinated_care">Coordinated care: teams and telehealth</a>

</dt>

<dd>

Fortified by the background in the previous two sections, we can
proceed to changes taking place in treatment settings, including new
ways of structuring teams and even sets of health care institutions,
and where these institutions need to draw on the technologies
discussed in the article.

</dd>

<dt>

<a href="#engagement_games">Patient empowerment</a>

</dt>

<dd>

People stand front and center throughout this survey of
technology. The article will culminate in the empowerment that
information technology offers people on their own or when engaging
with the health care establishment.

</dd>

<h2>Devices, sensors, and patient monitoring</h2>
</a>

<p>

When many people think of medical devices, enormous clanking machines
that might cost a million dollars or more come to mind (such as for
radiology, MRIs, CT scans, or lab analysis). The output from these
devices tends to pass through labs, radiologists, or other medical
oracles while the patient chews her finger-nails and waits several
days for results. But as in other technologies, miniaturization is
transforming medical equipment. Lots of small devices are already in
use, with pacemakers and other cardio implants bringing dramatic
improvements to quality of life. Other devices bring health data into
the hands of ordinary people--even turning up
in <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/samsung-galaxy-s5-bigger-faster-better-7000026691/">smartphones</a>.

</p>

<a name="qs_selves">
<h3>Digital building blocks of a health plan</h3>
</a>

<p>

Attendees at the
high-profile <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/consumer-electronics-show-will-highlight-new-ways-to-collect-biometric-data/2014/01/05/e8eac584-74c4-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html">Consumer
Electronics Show</a> at the beginning of 2014 lost themselves in a sea
of personal monitoring devices. Whether or not these early consumer
devices take off, self-monitoring is on the verge of becoming
mainstream,
<a href="http://www.fiercemobileit.com/story/research-mobile-health-app-market-quadruple-2016/2011-11-30">with
the use of apps expected to expand rapidly</a>. Gadgets marketed to
consumers can bypass many of the barriers to development, regulatory
approval, and marketing that currently keep devices expensive and
focused on a single task.

</p>
<p>

Technologies supporting
the <a href="http://quantifiedself.com/">Quantified Self movement</a>
include the following:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Fitbits and other wearable measurement devices
are <a href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/wearable-fitness-devices-see-historic-surge-popularity">surging
in popularity</a>. Just walk through a consumer electronics store to
see how widespread and available these devices are. Many measure not
only activity, but also health-related vital signs such as pulse,
blood pressure, and oxygen consumption.

</li>

<li>

Devices are becoming easier and friendlier to use. For instance,
the <a href="http://theheartcheck.com/products/pen_device.html">HeartCheck
Pen</a> is a small, pen-sized device that takes readings from the
thumbs when pressed onto the sensor pads--a device of potential value
to people at risk for stroke and heart attacks.
The <a href="http://bionym.com/">Nymi</a> is a bracelet that measures
one's ECG from the wrist and fingertip. Diabetes patients need to
measure glucose levels frequently and manage insulin dosing to prevent
hyperglycemic complications and avoid hypoglycemic episodes,
so <a href="http://www.medgadget.com/2013/10/non-invasive-measurement-of-blood-glucose-levels-using-glucotrack-interview.html">non-invasive
measurement devices</a> now avoid the need for frequent skin
pricks--one such
device <a href="http://www.healthline.com/health-news/diabetes-google-develops-glucose-monitoring-contact-lens-012314">embedded
in a contact lens</a>. Although currently positioned only as an
authentication technology (a security device to replace passwords),
the possible medical applications of a mobile device that measures ECG
for things such as cardiac disease monitoring are exciting.

</li>

<li>

Wristbands and finger clips may soon seem quaintly awkward,
with <a href="http://spie.org/x105127.xml">even greater
miniaturization on the way</a>. Reductions in size democratize
medicine in many ways: by lowering the costs of devices, by making
them more attractive and comfortable (a critical consideration for
widespread adoption), and by reducing power requirements. For example,
sensors warning of concussions can
be <a href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/remote-sensors-making-play-concussion-fray">worn
under sports helmets</a> or embedded directly in them,
although <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/15/health/youth-head-sensors/">their
accuracy is disputed</a>.

</li>

<li>

Sensors embedded in pill containers
can <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/study-shows-promise-electronic-pill-bottle">notify
doctors when the patients have taken their medication</a>. This can
help clinicians remind patients
and <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-03/acoc-prv030613.php">encourage
medication adherence</a>, which is a major problem in maintaining
health because so many patients forget their pills or need urging to
adhere to their regimens. If smart packaging sounds like science
fiction, just
consider <a href="http://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-08-fda-electronic-chips-medications.html">ingestible
pills</a> that work together with a body patch and a smart phone to
signal when they're digested.

</li>

<li>

A chip <a href="http://www.me.gatech.edu/news/degertekinchip">small
enough to be sent through blood vessels</a> returns ultrasound
measurements of the vessels or the heart. Researchers expect to shrink
it further.

</li>

<li>

Robots can be seen
increasingly <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/mobile/10-medical-robots-that-could-change-healthcare/d/d-id/1107696">roaming
the hospital corridors</a>, and will eventually turn up in nursing
care facilities and even the home as well.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

People use personal devices to measure improvements in personal goals
and bolster their determination to achieve even more (although as we
will see, most of the devices and apps are not used for very long).
Devices also connect people with others engaged in fitness programs
and form communities for support.

</p>

<p>

Although some people can benefit individually from reading and
interpreting the displays on their devices, the data is most valuable
when inserted into a patient record and combined with data from other
users. In a patient record, the data can
be <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2013/09/ginger-io-putting-the-patient-provider-connection-at-the-center.html">checked
by clinical experts and be mined for trends</a>. Combining data from
many users enables such benefits such as finding out where they stand
relative to the population as a whole. Are you better or worse off
than the norm? Are your vital signs in a danger zone?

</p>

<a name="individual_home">
<h3>Environmental sensors: where do you feel the pain?</h3>
</a>

<p>

With mobile phones and dedicated consumer devices to support the quest
for health, the trend today is to manage chronic conditions, the
difficulties of aging, and recovery from traumatic events and
surgery--really, anything that benefits from close attention by
clinicians--in the environments where the patients spends their
time. And what could make more sense? After all, the patient's
symptoms occur in the environment where he or she spends her time. The
Institute for the Future writes, "Health care is moving from an acute,
episodic care model to a more continuous, chronic care model." (Page 7
of <a href="http://www.iftf.org/uploads/media/SR-1194%20Booting%20Up%20Mobile%20Health.pdf">the
paper</a>). That paper also lays out the move from the professional
setting to the patient's environment, and the crucial role that will
be played by mobile devices and sensors in the hands of patients.

</p>
<p>

Dueling trends are at work as devices bring the clinic into the
home. On the one hand, consumer devices are unfolding
the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-03/fitness-apps-eclipse-3-d-tvs-as-digital-health-reaches-ces-tech.html">
vision expressed by health IT leader Samir Damani: "We are really
moving from a doctor-centric society to a patient-centric
society."</a> On the other hand, sensors can be scary and
intrusive. Obviously, consumers will rebel against monitoring unless
their privacy is respected and they feel like partners improving their
own health with the support of the clinician and technology.

</p>

<p>

The home is not the only place that can join the clinic and the
hospital as health settings--other important places in people's lives,
such
as <a href="http://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/beacon-community-program/beacon-support-childrens-health-lessons-learned/">schools</a>
and workplaces, can as well. Public interest in health tools outside
clinical settings
is <a href="http://healthworkscollective.com/brad-wright/150176/global-study-finds-majority-believe-traditional-hospitals-will-be-obsolete-near-f">growing
worldwide</a>.

</p>

<a name="barrier_device">
<h3>Barriers to devices and sensors</h3>
</a>

<p>

In addition to personal or cultural aversion, the barriers that hold
back adoption of sensor technologies include:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

Efficacy

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

It takes a long time and a lot of money to develop a medical
treatment, and sometimes even more time and money to establish that
it's safe and works better than a placebo. Small devices present fewer
headaches than drugs because any safety problems they pose are likely
to be concrete and obvious. Clinical trials for devices are much
simpler than drug trials for a host of reasons, ranging from the high
failure rate of new chemical compounds to the more straightforward
safety considerations of external devices.

</p>

<p>

Still, to line up people with the right combination of medical
conditions, ensure they follow instructions, and measure effects
(especially over a long time period) is a big job. Given so many
competing, poorly tested apps, most fail to appeal to users or to be
particularly effective.
<a href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/report-paints-grim-diabetes-app-use-mHealth-mobile">Few
are downloaded by a lot of people</a> (for instance, only 1.2% of the
smart-phone enabled diabetes population uses apps), and far fewer are
used over a long period of time. This resistance holds back market
penetration, makes it hard to gather statistically significant
measures of their efficacy, and dampens investors' incentive to
improve products.

</p>

<p>

Although most manufacturers of the current generation of consumer
devices are careful to label them for "fitness" rather than "health,"
there is a point where their use can trespass onto the realm regulated
by government. The FDA has even declared jurisdiction
over <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-to-regulate-some-medical-related-apps/">mobile
phone apps that have clear medical purposes</a> and
has <a href="http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/himss14-FDA-criticism-mobile-app-regulatory-process-47279-1.html">reviewed
more than 100 such apps</a>, although the agency is doing its best to
keep its hands off popular devices and apps for casual use. Its
regulatory jurisdiction extends over devices used for diagnosis or
treatment of specific medical conditions, not health in general.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Cost

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

If we can save lives and avoid emergency room visits or other costly
treatments, a medical device comes cheap at almost any price.
FDA-approved cardiac devices and other implants have established
themselves as cost-effective. But no one can guarantee that the
emerging generation of consumer and patient devices really does what
people fervently hope them to do. In the meantime, most people (and
their insurers) still think twice before buying a gadget of unclear
value.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Data quality

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Different devices can report different measurements, raising
suspicions about their trustworthiness. Each device may produce
information that's useful in a relative sense (i.e., how much the
value goes up and down over time) but perhaps not useful in its
absolute values.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Simplicity

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Consumers who are content to spend days setting up a home
entertainment center seem to lose patience when it comes to devices
that improve their health. If the interface is more than a single
button, many will give up at the start. Simplicity must also be the
rule in displays. It's particularly important for the elderly (who did
not grow up with ubiquitous computer technology) and for anyone
injured or impaired (chemotherapy and dementia are just two of the
burdens that affect one's ability to remember and follow technical
instructions).

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Overmeasurement

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

People can get compulsive when measuring themselves, and overinterpret
arbitrary changes that take place day to day or hour to hour.
Measuring your blood pressure can raise your blood pressure! Throwing
data into a bucket doesn't improve our knowledge; we should determine
our goals first and then collect the data that we can process to help
reach the goals.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Interoperability

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

When a home or the hospital room contains multiple sensors and
devices, they need to work together to be contribute to a holistic
view of a patient. Some standards exist to help devices communicate,
such as the Data Distribution Service (DDS), MQ Telemetry Transport
(MQTT), and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). In an
age where coordinated systems keep airplanes on course, it's
ridiculous that most medical devices are not designed to work with
other devices.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Integration with records

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Before data can enter patient records, systems must be designed to
gather well-structured patient data, and appropriate privacy and
security controls must be in place. Few electronic health systems
currently accept data directly from patients, who still fill out paper
forms to be entered by clerks into electronic formats. Furthermore,
patients will be tempted to falsify data under some circumstances
(such as incentives dangled by employee reward programs), so there
must be technical measures to prevent tampering with device
output. Some clinicians mistrust patient-generated data, even though
most of the information in clinical interviews comes from patients
anyway.

</p>

</dd>

</dl>

<p>

An Endeavour
Partners <a href="http://endeavourpartners.net/assets/Endeavour-Partners-Wearables-White-Paper-20141.pdf">white
paper</a> found that one-third of people who buy wearable devices give
them up within six months, and half within two years (Page 4). This is
not necessarily bad: perhaps the users felt that their use of the
devices during that short period was sufficient to meet their goals,
such as losing weight or establishing a regular exercise routine. But
in the quest for long-term use, the white paper proposes nine criteria
that could bond users to their fitness devices. In addition to
psychological factors such as attractiveness, ease of use, and
reinforcing the user's goals, the white paper urges the provision of
an API so that data from devices can be integrated.

</p>

<p>

Self-tracking is certainly taking off. According to
a <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/files/old-media//Files/Reports/2013/PIP_TrackingforHealth%20with%20appendix.pdf">Pew
report<a>, 69% of Americans track some aspect of health for themselves
or a loved one (although usually without digital devices), and 63% of
trackers believe it has had some positive effect. Whether or not
tracking was really responsible for the change, believing that it does
is a good enough reason to do it. The huge base of Quantified Selfers
can give researchers crucial data to isolate the factors that work
most often.

</p>

<p>

Device manufacturers can then base their designs on factors known to
be effective, and demonstrate the value of the devices. Finally, the
more these devices interoperate and support the integration of their
data, the more they can contribute to the larger health system. This
system includes the records that will store the data and the research
that will mine its insights.

</p>

<a name="using_data">
<h2>Using data: records, public data sets, and research</h2>
</a>

<p>

Just as we don't think often about the electrons coursing through most
of the tools we use in twenty-first century life (until the bars on
our screen shrink to an alarming low), we don't often notice the data
that connects us. For medical devices, data is paramount because it's
what we want from the devices in the first place. Data injects power
throughout the rest of the health care system.

</p>

<p>

This section will look first at how data is gathered, stored, and
analyzed, then at the use of open data sets and the role of shared
data in clinical research. All of these initiatives potentially
improve health through shared data and its analysis.

</p>

<a name="ehr">
<h3>Electronic health record systems</h3>
</a>

<p>

Walking into clinics where the staff carry around paper records makes
you feel like you caught an old 1930s movie and should be seeing the
scene in black and white. Recently, superficial signs of progress have
taken hold. Policy-makers in the United States boasts about the
increasing adoption of electronic records, particularly
<a href="http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/onc-data-brief-7-december-2012.pdf">since
the roll-out of Meaningful Use incentives in 2009</a>. But don't jump
to conclusions about the capabilities of new electronic systems: many
are harder to use than the paper records they replace, and barely more
useful for data sharing and analysis.

</p>

<p>

In the United States, virtually every doctor uses electronic records
and exchange for billing, because money is the lifeblood of both the
health practices and the payers. But other activities, even something
as basic as ordering a prescription from a pharmacy, are done
manually.

</p>

<p>

When clinical patient records do get digitized, they remain what one
doctor called an "electronic file cabinet," separate from all the work
of planning and executing care. This article will refer to such
documents as an electronic health record (or EHR), because that term
is compact and commonly heard. But we must really think of patient
records as a critical component of an entire health system that
involves a sequence of events with each patient, along with analytics
that set the direction of whole collections of clinics and
hospitals. And one question running through this article is how health
institutions can use the EHR can be used more effectively throughout
their operation to support what reformers like to call
a <a href="http://iom.edu/Reports/2012/Best-Care-at-Lower-Cost-The-Path-to-Continuously-Learning-Health-Care-in-America.aspx"><em>learning
health care system</em></a>.

</p>

<p>

In other day-to-day activities, we're used to making orders online and
preserving data electronically. The same kinds of benefits come from
electronic records: easier appointments, expedited drug orders and
refills, faster billing and reimbursement, etc.

</p>

<p>

Looking beyond convenience is the promise of clinical decision support
(CDS). Doctors can't keep in their prefrontal cortexes all the
information they need to suggest accurate diagnoses and
treatments--even the doctors (grudgingly) admit that, which is why
specialists and consultations exist. How can electronic records
augment clinicians' intelligence?

</p>

<ul>

<li>

At the most basic level, record systems emit alerts to warn clinicians
of actions they propose that are inconsistent with the data in the
records, such as when a patient has an allergy to a medication or the
dose seems wrong. Alerts, from cardiac monitors, intravenous delivery
devices, and other equipment attached to patients are aimed at nursing
staff (and sometimes drive them distraction, literally).

</li>

<li>

Electronic records also prompt diagnostic and reimbursement codes, and
suggest drugs appropriate to the data entered about
diseases. Unfortunately, electronic systems have not proven able to do
this reliably. The Insurance Institute for HIT Safety
writes, <a href="http://www.iihits.com/clinical-decision-support.html">"CDS
appears to pose a slew of medical legal risks...while offering few--if
any--protections."</a>

</li>

<li>

The cutting edge of computer support can be seen in experimental
software that generates diagnoses when fed patient histories. Such
"expert systems" were tried in medicine as far back as the 1980s, but
fizzled out in the face of limitations in hardware power, speed, and
memory as well as the lack of flexible database technology. With the
enormous speed-up in computing and the rebirth of artificial
intelligence in the twenty-first century, researchers
are <a href="http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2013/02/12/the-computer-that-could-replace-your-doctor/">trying
again</a> to see whether the doctor can be rendered superfluous. IBM's
Watson, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/ibm-forms-watson-business-group-will-commercialization-follow-7000024929/">which
they started to commercialize in January 2014</a>, famously proved
that natural language analysis can bring to the surface multiple
plausible diagnoses for doctors to choose from. But we should
take <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/10/doctors-or-algorithms/">predictions
about the obsolescence of the doctor</a> with a grain of salt.

</li>

<li>

A digital health system can help the staff intervene with patients,
through such simple measures as reminding them to schedule and come to
follow-up visits. These sorts of interventions can reduce the risk of
hospitalization among high-risk patients, such
<a href="http://www.fiercehealthit.com/story/tech-helps-control-diabetes-western-new-york-beacon-community/2013-12-12">those
suffering from diabetes</a>. This is a clear example of technology
that supports, instead of interfering with, the relationship between
clinician and patient.

</li>
<li>

A well-structured record-based system can flag patients at high risk,
telling staff where to concentrate their attention.

</li>

<li>

A patient web portal can allow clients to make appointments, check
results of tests, check for errors in diagnoses or medication lists,
and communicate with the staff for non-urgent questions. This is a
fairly obvious application of digital technology in an age when most
people can schedule car repairs and hotel reservations through web
sites, but it's surprising how few clinical practices are capable of
such basic online interaction.

</li>

<li>

Analysis of large data sets can turn up problems that help agencies
improve public health. They can also reduce costs by helping hospitals
identify and prioritize high-risk patients (a process called patient
stratification). Payers use analytics to define
<a href="http://www.ncsl.org/portals/1/documents/health/EPISODE_of_CARE-2010.pdf">"episodes
of care"</a> that supposedly encompass all the treatment a patient
needs for a particular problem. This in turn lets the payers define
how much to reimburse health providers for treating various patients
with the same condition.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Some large institutions--notably the Department of Veterans Affairs,
with its famous VistA software, and Kaiser Permanente--have
historically created relatively well-integrated health systems that
support sophisticated interventions to improve patient health. Their
achievements crown long-term processes of integrating multiple
hospital systems around the records and training all their clinicians
to take advantage of the data tracked by the record systems.
Institutions can do this when they shoulder a comprehensive role in
patients' lives, insuring them as well as treating them. They
represent the kind of all-encompassing, long-lasting coverage that
many developed countries do at a national level, and that we will look
at <a href="#aco_integrated">under the topic of accountable care
organizations</a>. According
to <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/the-industry-standard/how-kaiser-bet-4-billion-electronic-health-records-and-won-217731">one
account</a>, Kaiser Permanente's four billion dollar expenditure on
electronic health records paid off.

</p>

<p>

Most deployments of electronic health records achieve considerably
less, however. Most EHR systems follow an old 1980s model of software
development:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

They are entirely proprietary, although standards (which we'll look at
shortly) have been superimposed and are beginning to allow limited
innovation in data sharing and analytics. Significant barriers to
entry (through regulatory capture and installed bases) have allowed
early entrants in the vendor space to lock in large market shares with
legacy technologies that are hard for innovators to supplant.

</li>

<li>

Most systems predate the Web or use rare technologies such as MUMPS
(standardized as the M language), with kludgy and limited work-arounds
just so that EHRs can meet such basic expectations as patient portals
and access by clinicians on mobile devices. More recent entrants in
the EHR space, such
as <a href="http://www.athenahealth.com/">Athenahealth</a>
and <a href="http://www.practicefusion.com">Practice Fusion</a>, have
chosen to go all-online (Software as a Service, or SaaS), providing
web-based records. They tend to be popular among physicians, but
Software as a Service stays in the hands of the software provider and
is therefore hard to adapt to individual health providers' needs.

</li>

<li>

Not being standards-based, existing software is expensive to develop,
install, and maintain. EHRs' market has therefore been large
institutions with millions of dollars to spend on licenses and
millions more on implementation. Until recently, proprietary EHR
vendors have totally bypassed the small community and rural providers
where digital records could tremendously improve care.

</li>

<li>

Many existing record systems have been developed to meet the interests
of the hospital and clinic administrators who make out purchase orders
and deal with third-party payers, not the interests of clinicians who
ultimately have to use the system for patient care. The chief purpose
of such EHRs is financial rather than clinical. For instance, some of
the "clinical decision support" built-in to these systems actually
tells doctors how to find the codes that legally maximize the payment
for a given course of treatment (a trick called "up-coding").

</li>

<li>

Although digitization has transformed other industries, such as
e-commerce and finance, by facilitating data exchange, the long
proprietary history of EHRs leaves them stubbornly resistant to
interoperability. The standards in this area have improved recently,
as we'll see later in the article. But
currently, <a href="http://www.chartspan.com/2014/02/access-to-your-healthcare-records/">it
is hard even for patients to obtain their own records</a>, on paper or
electronically--a right enshrined in law through HIPAA.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

The incentives in the
<a href="http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/hitech-act">HITECH
act</a>, part of the 2008 economic recovery
act, <a href="http://dashboard.healthit.gov/HITAdoption/">spurred
adoption of electronic health record systems</a>. But improvements in
quality through electronic records are more elusive. Although most
studies show improvements in care, they turn out to be small and
scattered. For instance:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)
found
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK37988/">some decrease in
unnecessary tests, and improvements in pediatric care, particularly
around prescriptions</a>. But many other areas showed no improvement,
or a statistically insignificant one.

</li>

<li>

A <a href="http://jamia.bmj.com/content/19/3/360.full">2011
article</a> in the Journal of the American Medical Informatics
Association also found benefits in medication prescription.

</li>

<li>

A <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0911734">New
England Journal of Medicine article</a> found that electronic record
systems reduced errors in medication, but no evidence that it reduced
errors in diagnosis.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

It should also be noted that, when trying to measure relative
successes and failures, researchers usually define "quality" as how
well doctors adhere to recommended standards of care. This is an
understandable metric to settle on, because standards of care are
precisely defined. It would be much harder to measure how much
patients actually improved. But this choice leaves a gap between what
"quality" means in clinical research the "rather simple statement"
from the landmark Institute of Medicine book, <em>Crossing the Quality
Chasm: A New Health System</em> (p. 44): "The ultimate test of the
quality of a health care system is whether it helps the people it
intends to help."

</p>

<p>

The designers of the HITECH act knew that adoption of a technology
does not guarantee effective exploitation of the technology's
benefits; that's why their reimbursement program was labeled
Meaningful Use in a top-down attempt to improve the way physicians use
records.

</p>

<p>

EHR systems, unfortunately, can be habit-forming whether or not they
provide the expected benefits. Institutions that adopt the systems
soon find themselves locked in, their data having entered a cryptic
format understood only by the vendor, so that data cannot be retrieved
to move it to a different system. When the systems are ill-suited to
modern habits (such as mobile access) or to new needs such as data
sharing, institutions find a transition prohibitively expensive and
disruptive.

</p>

<p>

So the US medical industry, under the guidance of the federal
government, is taking on a huge collective risk: that EHRs promising
Meaningful Use
may <a href="http://www.emrandehr.com/2014/02/26/himss14-highlights-the-snails-pace-of-interoperability/">fail
to meet the new requirements, such as data exchange</a>, during the
day-to-day knocking about they receive (even if they are certified as
Meaningful Use compliant). Thousands of new health practices adopting
the EHRs would then join the earlier adopters as fellow prisoners.

</p>

<p>

Electronic record systems definitely improve safety in some ways--such
as eliminating confusion in handwritten notes, and displaying warnings
about adverse drug reactions--but
can <a href="http://cci.drexel.edu/faculty/ssilverstein/cases/">introduce
other sources of error</a>. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a
major
<a href="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2011/Health-IT-and-Patient-Safety-Building-Safer-Systems-for-Better-Care.aspx">report
warning about safety problems in November 2011</a>, the AHRQ prepared
a <a href="http://healthit.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/citation/HealthITHazardManagerFinalReport.pdf">report
on tracking and assessing risks in electronic health systems</a> in
May 2012 (a summary of risks appears on page 29), and the Office of
the National Coordinator, which is responsible for administering the
government's electronic health record program, released
<a href="http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/safer">extensive
safety guidelines in January 2014</a>. Besides plain and simple
bugs--for which vendors deny liability--problems include:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Confusing interfaces that make it seem that some information was
recorded when it was not, or the reverse.

</li>

<li>

Arbitrary restrictions, such as drop-down menus that leave out the
medications or other choices that the clinician wants to make.  Such
counterproductive designs
can <a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2014/02/decision-support-tools-harm-patients.html">tie
up busy doctors and drive them to enter wrong data</a>.

</li>

<li>

Records that allow similar information in two or more places, thus
creating such risks as duplicate doses. This can certainly happen with
paper records too, but electronic records hide the duplication better
and staff are less likely to know that duplicate locations exist.

</li>

<li>

Information that is hard to see, perhaps simply because it is outside
the visible part of the page and the clinician forgets to scroll the
screen.

</li>

<li>

Arbitrary decisions and defaults that
are <a href="https://www.hospitalmedicine.org/AM/Glycemic/pdf/Banner_Good_Samaritan_Medical_Center_Cerner_Screenshots.pdf">hard
to discern</a> and differ on each screen.

</li>

<li>

Overuse of alerts. EHRs and hospital devices are programmed to react
crudely to triggers, and manufacturers have set the triggers very
sensitive from fear of missing something important. The result is that
a doctor often cannot get through a write-up of a routine visit
without clicking on innumerable dialog boxes to make them go away; for
instance, some systems blindly report every possible side effect to
using a medication. Clinicians get used to ignoring the alerts and
ultimately might miss one that they really should have heeded.
Although EHRs theoretically allow doctors to customize the alerts that
appear, no one has yet created a truly intelligent alert system with
acceptable levels both of false negatives (which should be zero) and
false positives (which are much too high now). Hospital wards are as
noisy as tropical forests with the sound of beeps instead of animal
calls. The constant din of multiple competing alerts creates a poor
signal-to-noise ratio.

</li>

<li>

Images that are distorted or have text overlaid in the wrong places.

</li>

<li>

Unauthorized sharing of patient data, intentionally or accidentally.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Like industrial accidents and airplane crashes, medical errors are
generally emergent properties, caused by complex interactions of many
factors such as haste, misreported symptoms, and plain bad luck. One
factor is often an EHR that gets in the way, hides information behind
multiple clicks, or presents a garbled display. Work-arounds such
as <a href="http://ehrintelligence.com/2014/02/21/ehr-nightmares-when-adoption-implementation-run-awry/">using
sticky notes to store information before entering it in the EHR</a>
lead to more errors.

</p>

<p>

Errors in electronic records also tend to propagate. In such cases,
one of the traits that makes them most valuable--data sharing--turns
into a vulnerability. And a data breach with EHRs can put millions of
patients at risk in one fell swoop, as front-page news reports
regularly remind us.

</p>

<p>

The reporting requirements that the government and insurers pile on,
potentially a boon for patient care and public health, create more
work that is often redundant. For instance, stage 1 of Meaningful Use
requires the doctor to report whether she checked the hemoglobin A1c
of each diabetic patient. In theory, electronic systems should take on
much of the clerical burden of such reporting requirements. The
information that the patient has diabetes and that the lab ran a
hemoglobin test is in the record, but current EHR systems do not
automatically report it, requiring the doctor instead to do so
manually. It would strike an observer as odd that such EHR systems
could pass certification as Meaningful Use compliant, but neither the
certification authorities nor the EHR vendors seem to care whether the
doctor's work in negatively impacted. No
wonder <a href="http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2014/01/23/Doctors-spend-third-of-time-with-patients-looking-at-computer/UPI-79101390532163/">doctors
spend a third of their time with patients looking at computer</a>,
imperiling their relationships with the patients (as we will see
later, the core of medicine is the relationship).

</p>

<p>

There's a movement among doctors for the FDA to regulate electronic
records in hospitals as medical devices. Certainly, the agency has the
tools
to <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm089593.pdf">validate
software quality for medical devices</a>, looking at the development
cycle, testing, and other external indicators of software quality.
Nor is the FDA a stranger to software validation: it
already <a href="http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/GeneralHospitalDevicesandSupplies/MedicalDeviceDataSystems/ucm251897.htm">regulates MDDS</a>,
which is a type of device
that collects, stores, and transmits data from monitors and other
medical devices, and has released
<a href="http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm085281.htm">principles of software validation</a>.
Requirements for EHRs might be along the lines of those
<a href="http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20040014965_2004000657.pdf">used
by NASA to certify critical aerospace software</a>.

</p>

<p>

Proponents claim that similar regulation for electronic medical
records, while increasing costs, will avert life-threatening
problems. The most compelling argument against extending regulation to
medical records is that the software would have to pass through the
validation process after every change, slowing updates. But if a
development process does not ensure quality, speed becomes a
liability. A new paradigm for developing and customizing electronic
records is probably more important than regulation. It might consist
of:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

Intense clinician involvement in design

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

The people using an interface must be part of the design team
throughout the project, not just brought in as external consultants
intermittently. Users who don't understand IT can collaborate with IT
professionals who don't understand medicine to create effective tools,
through iterative development and rapid prototyping. Some people say
that the relative success of VistA sprang from its genesis among
doctors and nurses at the Department of Veterans Affairs, who did much
of their own coding. All institutions that are happy with their
electronic systems have declared that the most crucial factor in their
success was bringing in the staff and making them feel ownership of
the transition. In fact, making a transition is so time-consuming that
it probably exceeds the costs of the software.

</p>
<p>

Even after products are released, user interfaces must be easier to
change. Electronic health records have some of the most notoriously
user-unfriendly interfaces in the software industry. As mentioned
earlier, the people making purchase decisions are usually in
administrative positions. The dissatisfaction that doctors express
about their record systems
is <a href="http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/news/physician-outcry-ehr-functionality-cost-will-shake-health-information-technol">legendary</a>. Some
of the complaints stem from clinicians that are not used to computers
(yes, quite a lot of them are in the field), from the urgency and
chaos endemic to many medical environments, or from resistance by
staff toward relinquishing familiar workflows. But sometimes the
record system imposes its own rigid workflow without just cause.

</p>

<p>

An
AHRQ <a href="http://www.himss.org/files/HIMSSorg/content/files/Code%20119%20-%20EHR%20Usability_Evaluation%20and%20Use%20Case%20Framework_AHRQ.pdf">study
on EHR usability</a> laid out fairly simple requirements for tying
patient information to treatment plans, but stressed the importance of
selecting only the relevant information and presenting it clearly.
Too often, neither EHR vendors nor internal IT departments understand
what the physicians need to see and do not respect the value of their
time. For instance, instructions for using software may be printed out
as part of the patient's record, probably by a programmer who couldn't
tell the difference between instructions and patient information. Such
awkward interfaces drain precious time from the physicians' and
nurses' days, reducing the time they can spend with patients and
contributing to the serious shortage of physicians that threatens the
hope for universally accessible health care in the US.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

More agile systems

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Even though every health institution is unique and adapting
electronic records to the enterprise is critical, most record systems
offer very few customizations. It's useful to allow doctors--as most record
systems do--to choose which medications appear on a list of treatments for
a particular condition, and which alerts pop up, but this is a far cry
from making the software blend into the office's workflow.

</p>

<p>

Serious changes to a product require an investment in certified
consultants, additional paid contract work with vendors, or extra
demands on overworked internal IT organizations that don't possess the
expertise to do the job. Changes that require vendor action take place
on the vendor's schedule. A common complaint among doctors is that new
EHR vendors act responsive and agile with their first customers, and
then turn just as blank and bureaucratic as all the older vendors when
success and growth come.

</p>

<p>

When local sites do make customizations, they may be swept away by the
next software upgrade. When smaller vendors go out of business or are
merged into larger firms, maintenance and tech support may vanish.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Better attention to safety

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

EHR vendors contractually deny responsibility for errors entered into
records through bugs or confusing interfaces. The health provider, who
is presumably able to check for and catch any errors, bears liability
for anything that goes wrong with a patient. To be fair, throughout
the computer industry, software manufacturers commonly assert no
warranty for software bugs. But the manufacturers should compensate by
providing transparent, convenient feedback and tracking systems for
bugs and product improvement suggestions.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

More transparency

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Contracts and vendor responsibilities could be much more balanced and
reasonable, as
<a href="http://jamia.bmj.com/site/icons/amiajnl8946.pdf">recommended
by the American Medical Informatics Association</a>. This includes
rights for software users as basic as discussing defects and the costs
of products.

</p>

</dd>

</ul>

<p>

Some problems of EHR systems are solved at lower cost through free
software. Free software or open source EHR systems include
<a href="http://openmrs.org/">OpenMRS</a>, <a href="http://home.tolvenhealth.com/">Tolven</a>, <a href="http://oscarcanada.org/">OSCAR</a>,
and several variants of VistA, whose development is now coordinated by
a foundation called <a href="http://www.osehra.org/">OSEHRA</a>.
VistA
is <a href="http://www.openhealthnews.com/hotnews/vista-rivals-epic-and-cerner-major-deployments-ehr-systems">gaining
a bigger installed base</a>, although its penetration is nowhere near
what its fame would seem to deserve.
The <a href="http://www.openhealthtools.org/">Open Health Tools</a>
consortium develops free software for clinical and research
use. Deployments of open source health records in developing nations
are <a href="http://www.pih.org/blog/university-hospitals-open-source-emr-a-model-for-evidence-based-health-care">supported
by Partners in Health</a>, among others.

</p>

<p>

The low adoption rate for these open source alternatives (at least in
the United States) has been blamed on disparate issues ranging from
sheer prejudice in the health care field to poor marketing. A good
deal of this open source software originated in academia or
government, and therefore isn't backed by strong sales or support
organizations. VistA's dependency on MUMPS also dissuades enough
potential developers that MUMPS wrappers have been created for other
languages. But at base, the problem may simply be that an EHR system
that truly makes life easy for clinicians has yet to be created.

It's also possible that online, SaaS systems with essentially no
administrative overhead are preempting any interest that might have
gone to open source EHRs. But for reasons of security and
accountability, it would be valuable even for the online systems to
publish their source code.

</p>

<p>

One of the foundations of innovation consists of public data sets
about providers, patients, and communities. But these public data sets
join patients as victims of electronic record systems that capture
data and don't interoperate well. We'll turn next to these data sets
and what they offer.

</p>

<a name="open_data">
<h3>Public data sets</h3>
</a>

<p>

Every year, the US Department of Health and Human Services holds a
large national forum on health data. Dubbed
a <a href="http://healthdatapalooza.org/">Health Datapalooza</a> by
the effusive Todd Park, former Department CTO, that name ultimately
took hold as the official moniker. The forum highlights new data sets
released by HHS and provides opportunities for activists as well as
potential entrepreneurs to talk intimately to HHS and each other about
uses to which they can put the data. This data then serves as a
platform upon which state authorities can target high-risk areas, web
sites can help patients choose health care providers, and other
unanticipated value can arise.

</p>

<p>

HHS was not only one of the first institutions in the United States to
offer open health data, but one of the first US agencies to join the
open data movement, spearheading
an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/open">open data gold rush on the
federal level</a>. Other countries offering health data
include <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jan/24/sharing-nhs-medical-records-healthcare">the
United Kingdom</a>
and <a href="http://www2.datasus.gov.br/DATASUS/index.php?area=02">Brazil</a>.

</p>

<p>

Public agencies gather huge amounts of valuable data, but its release
to health providers may lag months behind the events tracked by the
data. This can be blamed on the efforts needed to curate and clean
that data, but also to bureaucracy, budgetary constraints, or
workflows that persist from pre-Internet ways of sharing data.

</p>

<p>

Sometimes it may be hard to figure out what we can learn from the
particular data being collected and released by governments, payers,
or providers. But researchers from astronomers to military strategists
have often had to draw on considerable cleverness to extract the
insights they need from the data they can get. One example in health
care is
the <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2013/06/moving-to-the-open-health-care-graph.html">use
of data on referrals to infer the quality of doctors</a>. Another
example is a <a href="http://projects.propublica.org/emergency/">site
that combines wait times reported by emergency rooms with traffic
reports</a> to suggest which emergency room will see a patient
fastest.

</p>

<p>

Interesting public health benefits are emanating from organizations
that manage to get their hands of data from lots of patients: services
chosen by patients such as PatientsLikeMe and Web-based EHRs. By
centralizing patient data, these companies can look for trends. For
instance, when the 2013 federal government shutdown forced the Centers
for Disease Control to stop tracking incidents of the flu,
<a href="http://www.athenahealth.com/blog/2013/10/04/athenaresearch-tracking-flu-activity-during-the-cdc-furlough/">Athenahealth
filled the gap</a>. However, as we'll see, privacy is better protected
if patients store data instead of relying on either doctors or
vendors.

</p>

<a name="coding">
<h3>Medical coding standards</h3>
</a>

<p>

Standards for entering diseases and patient conditions complicate
clinical data
entry. Both <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_main.html">SNOMED</a>
and
the <a href="http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf">ICD
series</a> are used to represent disease, but most billing in the
United States requires ICD. Although the latest version, ICD-10, was
finalized in 1990, and work on its successor ICD-11 is well underway,
many US health organizations are still using the older ICD-9.

</p>

<p>

Based on assessments
that <a href="http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/ahima/bok1_036866.hcsp?dDocName=bok1_036866">ICD-10
will improve individual patient care, public health, and medical
research</a>, the government is now requiring a move to ICD-10 that is
<a href="http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/issues/22_2/Countdown-to-ICD-10-47180-1.html">straining
health organizations to a worrisome degree</a>. ICD-9 was already hard
to traverse, at 18,000 codes, but ICD-10 increases this number to
87,000 (see the Background section on
<a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/solutions-managing-your-practice/coding-billing-insurance/hipaahealth-insurance-portability-accountability-act/transaction-code-set-standards/icd10-code-set.page">this
page</a>). And ICD-10, developed as a reimbursement and billing tool,
is hardly a perfect map of medical knowledge, especially with
accelerating change from genomics, metabolomics, and systems biology.
The American Medical Association labels the requirement to use ICD-10
as a
<a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/washington/icd-10-letter-to-cms-12feb2014.pdf">distraction
that will detract from the investments that physicians need to improve
patient care</a>.

As mentioned earlier, patients are variable. Not only are there many
distinct medical conditions, but one condition will affect
another. The designers of the ICD standards understood this and made a
stab at representing relationships by extending the set. For instance,
ICD-10 code Ill covers "Hypertensive heart and kidney disease" as well
as "Hypertensive heart disease, w CHF." The standard also tries to
represent adverse effects of treatments through its T80 codes. But
this is a game that could go on forever. A essentially flat, minimally
hierarchical list of individual codes can't possibly represent the
complexity of interactions between medical conditions.

</p>

<p>

A superior way to approach intersecting diseases may be for a standard
to represent diagnoses for individual diseases (at whatever level of
detail researchers find useful) but create links between diseases, so
that a doctor can indicate that one condition has caused, exacerbated,
or hidden another. The Semantic Web is an example of how this can be
done,
and <a href="https://dkm.fbk.eu/index.php/ICD-10_Ontology">ontologies
for ICD-10 already exist</a>. Of course, representing relationships
will still be a complicated task. We can only hope that tools for
doctors and coders will emerge.

<h3>Reframing clinical research</h3>
</a>

<p>

Clinical research is the foundation of modern health--the rite through
which new truths are revealed and verified--but even this hallowed
institution is undergoing wrenching change. Researchers have been
embarrassed by evidence
that <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21588057-scientists-think-science-self-correcting-alarming-degree-it-not-trouble">few
scientific controlled experiments can be replicated</a>, and that
<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/publishers-withdraw-more-than-120-gibberish-papers-1.14763">top
publishers have been tricked into publishing computer-generated
trash</a>.  Many shibboleths erected by clinical research in health
care have been overturned through retrospective, longitudinal
studies. Conflicts of interest
also <a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2014/02/evidencedbased-guidelines-today-malpractice-tomorrow.html">muddy
the reliability of clinical research</a>.

</p>

<p>

Additionally, big pharma is in trouble. Household names--Pfizer,
Merck, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb--who lavished
billions of dollars on advertising, wooing doctors, sponsoring
conferences, and lobbying officials are reaching the end of flush
times. They have apparently already invented all the
blockbusters--billion-dollar drugs that treat large numbers of people
for common ailments--so they now need to invest increasing sums to
find more elusive compounds serving smaller populations, and therefore
generating smaller profit margins.

</p>

<p>

Compounding their distress is the
<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-11-14/2014-outlook-big-pharma-drugs-going-off-patent">expiration
of patents that allow companies to enforce high prices</a> through an
effective monopoly on popular medications, and ever stricter
requirements for clinical
trials <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2805%2967712-4/fulltext">imposed
by the FDA after disturbing safety lapses such the Vioxx case</a>.
For a number of reasons--some pertaining to FDA funding, but others
springing from the difficulties of developing safe and effective
drugs--<a href="http://www.sci-tech-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=023001ATK5PN">the
FDA is approving many fewer drugs than in the early 1990s</a>.
Finally, researchers are having so much trouble getting patients in
the US to sign up for clinical trials that a lack of subjects is cited
as the reason behind
<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/doctors-too-few-cancer-patients-154156014.html">the
40% of cancer trials that don't run to completion</a>.

</p>

<p>

Despite ongoing research efforts in genomics, biology, high-throughput
screening, data analysis, and biotechnology, there have been no recent
game-changing breakthroughs to unjam pharmaceutical progress, so
companies are starting to look with a newly creative eye at clinical
research. Innovations include:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Looking for new incentives and means of outreach to increase the pool
of patients willing to undergo trials.

</li>

<li>

Using big data analytics to improve the targeting of diseases and the
design of trials (including criteria for selecting participants), and
using electronic records better to support trial operations,
administration and data collection.

</li>

<li>

Giving patients more of a say in the conduct of trials. Cracks are
appearing in the research ivory tower
through <a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2014/02/crowdsourcing-develop-clinical-trials.html">experiments
in crowdsourcing</a>, such as submitting drafts for clinical trials
for public scrutiny, and even letting patients recommend what trials
to run.

</li>

<li>

Cooperating around basic research, called "pre-competitive" research,
that precedes their efforts to produce a marketable result such as a
drug compound.

</li>

<li>

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/larryhusten/2014/01/30/johnson-johnson-will-share-clinical-trial-data/">Releasing
data from clinical trials</a>, notably those trials that produce
negative results most drug companies would rather not make public.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

These all aim at a less top-down, more collaborative development
process. A whole class of games such
as <a href="http://eterna.cmu.edu/web/">Eterna</a> engage the curious
public to solve problems in genetics. Crowdsourcing sites such
as <a href="http://folding.stanford.edu/">Folding@home</a> just ask
for our space computer cycles,
like <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI@Home</a>
famously does for astronomy.

</p>

<p>

Collaborative research requires data sharing, which in turn requires
some agreement on formats and categorization of data.
<a href="http://sagebase.org/about-2/">Sage Bionetworks</a> is one of
the organizations working on tools and standards for
collaboration. A <a href="http://www.openhealthnews.com/resources/health-it-category/genomics-genetic-medicine">wide
range of repositories</a>, such
as <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">the Cancer Genome Atlas</a>,
offer fodder for researchers.

</p>

<p>

But data sharing can be a career-limiting move. Pharma companies risk
that a competitor will build a patentable compound on top of their
research and steal their market share. Lab scientists risk having
someone else publish first (rival researchers have been known to win
or lose publication races by a few days). Perhaps the health field
needs to broaden its range of awards, so that a patent or published
paper is not the gold standard for advancing careers and funding.

</p>

<p>

Meanwhile, a lot of people have decided not to wait for clinical
trials, because they cost millions and can't satisfy every question
patients ask. The trials' results often don't even apply to many
patients, because trial participants should be "ideal" subjects,
healthy except for the condition the drug is meant to treat. Some
patients are engaging in citizen science to host clinical trials or
establish looser frameworks for discovering new cures.

</p>

<p>

Patients also come together through organizations such
as <a href="http://www.patientslikeme.com/">PatientsLikeMe</a>
and <a href="https://www.23andme.com">23andMe</a> (which has had to
suspend health-related activities after a dispute with the FDA over
their claims) to upload personal genomics and disease information for
data mining that
can <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v29/n5/full/nbt.1837.html">turn
up trends long before clinical researchers could establish them
formally</a>. These health sites could be viewed as turbo-charged,
data-driven upgrades to the forums that patients spontaneously form on
social networks. They also represent a digital form of
disease-specific <a href="http://www.geneticalliance.org/">patient
alliances</a>.

</p>

<a name="ehr_barrier">
<h3>Barriers to using data</h3>
</a>

<p>

As the previous sections showed, data is everywhere, waiting to be
used. Barriers to reaping its benefits include:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

Patient variability

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

The intractable individuality of patients was one factor that doomed
early expert systems. Nobody is a pure specimen of any single
condition; everyone has complicating factors that require subtle
weighings of possibilities. Therefore, no simple field on a chart or
in an electronic record can capture every nuance of patient behavior.
Diseases and conditions also interact, sometimes in non-obvious ways:
for instance, knee injuries are related to obesity, while diabetes and
urinary tract infections can exacerbate dementia. Complex histories
are hard to record: a check-box indicating whether or not a patient
smokes can't indicate whether he smoked for thirty years but
successfully gave it up. Furthermore, computer systems can't take into
account that patients and doctors differ in their abilities to obtain,
adhere to, pay for, deliver, and respond to treatments.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Unstructured data

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Due partly to patient variability and partly to a long habitude of
clinicians to use paper notes, an estimated 80% of medical data enters
records as free-form text, along with images that also count as
unstructured data. For most analytics, these records present a brick
wall, although there have been recent advances in natural language
processing for medical records. IBM's Watson was already mentioned;
other entrants in the space
include <a href="http://clinithink.com/solutions/">Clinithink</a> and
<a href="http://www.nuance.com/for-healthcare/resources/clinical-language-understanding/index.htm">Nuance</a>.
As an example of the difficulties such software must surmount, one can
easily pick out the words "cocaine use," but miss that the phrase
occurred in the context, "cocaine use proven not to be a factor."

</p>

<p>

Even if doctors enter data into structured fields, the EHR software
may provide several different fields that could plausibly store the
data, so the same information for different patients may be in
different places in the record.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Privacy

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Many health practitioners claim that regulations raise barriers to
useful data exchange, thereby holding back coordinated care. The heavy
weight of regulation cannot be denied: in the US we have the famous
HIPAA law, continually augmented by hundreds of pages of interpret
regulations that change every few years, plus many state laws
specifically dealing with health privacy.  Small health providers
complain
that <a href="http://healthitsecurity.com/2013/12/04/small-healthcare-providers-digging-through-hipaa-paperwork/">compliance
places an outsized burden on them</a>. But this is an area of much
contentious debate, with many sophisticated clinical and IT leaders
saying that HIPAA does not have to restrict useful data sharing and
that it is simply misinterpreted by providers.

</p>

<p>

In fact, HIPAA has limited scope and fails to cover important privacy
gaps. For instance, its "safe harbor" method of deidentifying patient
data predates current advances in security and privacy protection, and
thus is
both <a href="http://www.privacyanalytics.ca/on-the-limits-of-the-hipaa-safe-harbor-de-identification-standard/">woefully
inadequate and unnecessarily restrictive</a>. On the positive side,
regulations were recently updated to ensure that
<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/businessassociates.html">business
associates to whom health providers gave patient data had to comply
with the law</a>. Business associates are companies to which health
provider outsource things such as billing and analytics, and who
should not be taking advantage of the patient data given to them for
such purposes.

</p>

<p>

Controversy exists over the collection of data from patients, even
when it's voluntary, because this data can be used for market research
and other activities patients might not support. Because money spent
to develop mobile apps cannot be recouped through sales, and because
HIPAA does not cover apps (having been passed before the category
existed), many
developers <a href="http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/January/15/checking-your-blood-pressure-you-can-sell-your-personal-information.aspx">collect
and resell data from users</a>. Patients also harbor quite reasonable
fears, discussed under <a href="#open_data">the section on public data
sets</a>, that a life insurance company, employer, or identity thief
could deidentify the data and use it against the patient.
<a href="http://patientprivacyrights.org/2005/02/testimony-of-dr-alan-f-westin-professor-of-public-law-government-emeritus-columbia-university-and-director-of-the-program-on-information-technology-health-records-and-privacy/">Widely
cited research by law professor Alan Westin</a> shows that consumers
worry about the safety of their patient data and want a say in where
their data goes.

</p>

<p>

Public data sets may hold the secrets to improved
medical treatment, but they are problematic from a privacy standpoint
because it's becoming easier and easier to identify patients who are
supposed be anonymous. Researcher Latanya Sweeney, who famously
<a href="http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_advcom_06-2005_testimony_sweeney.pdf">reidentified
Massachusetts Governor William Weld</a> from publicly available data
in 1997, pulled off a similar feat in
2013 <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-06-05/states-hospital-data-for-sale-leaves-veteran-s-privacy-at-risk">using
health data from the state of Washington state</a>. Data providers are
improving their anonymization techniques, but they are fighting a
constant battle against increasingly sophisticated data mining
algorithms and the increasing availability of data sets on ordinary
people.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Consent

</dt>

<p>

It would be too cumbersome to make researchers return to all their
research subjects to ask permission for every new use of data, but we
need some method to let patients grant permissions for certain kinds
of research they support. Most patients do want their data used to
improve health outcomes. The debate over patient data parallels that
being conducted about the use of patient tissues and other physical
samples. There are no clear answers, but only trade-offs to choose
among. Both Sage Bionetworks and
the <a href="https://www.broadinstitute.org/files/news/pdfs/GAWhitePaperJune3.pdf">Broad
Institute</a> are exploring solutions.

</p>

<dt>

Conversion

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Organizations generally collect data in self-contained databases. A
surprisingly large number still use flat files or spreadsheets.
Although they could upload those spreadsheets and force users to
download and disassemble them, data sets are more accessible when
converted to a more computer-friendly format that allows simple
programmatic querying. Converting data, as well as creating and
maintaining future data in this way takes a big investment in many and
IT expertise. It can't be done just once, unless the enterprise adopts
new technology, policies, and procedures to generate or incorporate
data into the same system accessed by the API.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Crushing standard compliance

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Health care systems usually have to recognize and produce data
reflecting numerous standards. We'll look at a few later in this
section. The standards also change over time (although not as fast as
the conditions they are trying to describe, leading to further
frustration among physicians), which calls on the integrators and
developers to absorb hundreds of pages of specifications for each new
version and make sure the electronic systems comply.

</p>

</dd>

</dl>

<p>

A feasible solution to the patient record problem would involve:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

Free software

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

A powerful open source EHR platform, widely adopted, could permit
rapid innovation as new medical discoveries reveal the need for new
data fields and interactions. Many projects larger than an EHR have
been developed using free software methods, including Linux. It is
noteworthy that
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/google-and-samsung-soar-into-list-of-top-10-linux-contributors/">most
Linux development is now contributed by large corporations</a>--Intel,
IBM, Red Hat, Google, Samsung, and even Microsoft--who understand that
investments in a robust, free software code base are paid back
many-fold in the form of other business opportunities. Hospitals and
governments have even greater incentives to support open source in
health. Proprietary vendors, to reduce their own development costs,
are getting more motivated to integrate with open-source solutions
(e.g., via middleware).

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Application programming interfaces (APIs)

<dd>

<p>

Modern computing treats data sources as platforms on which other
people can build applications. Cloud storage, with a standard
interface into the data, allows innovators to flock to the underlying
platform and enrich it through add-on
software. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-restful/">RESTful
APIs</a> are quite flexible, have been popular for years, and are
supported by powerful libraries in nearly every programming
language. Focusing electronic record systems on the back-end tasks of
data management, while turning themselves into platforms for others to
provide user-friendly interfaces, workflow support, and analytics is
<a href="http://robertrowleymd.com/2014/03/01/ehrs-platforms/">catching on<a>.

</p>

<p>

Promising initiatives come from the giant health plan
<a href="http://share.kaiserpermanente.org/article/interchangesm-by-kaiser-permanente-unleashes-the-power-of-digital-health-through-open-api/">Kaiser
Permanente's Interchange</a>, from the
payer/provider <a href="https://developer.carepass.com/">Aetna's
CarePass</a>, and from the online record system
<a href="http://www.athenahealth.com/cmp/more-disruption/more-disruption.php">athenahealth's
More Disruption Please<a/>. All of these institutions have offered
platforms for third-party developers to develop applications based on
their services.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Analytics

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

The data in electronic records needs to be useful if we expect it to
be used. It value comes largely from analytics that can extract trends
from information about patients and the institutions treating them.
Currently, "big data" (a convenient catch-all phrase for the enhanced
statistical techniques now being used to explore correlations among
large and often relatively unstructured data sets) is entering health
care through numerous small companies wielding mind-numbing analytical
expertise--expertise for which
they <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/11/11/data-scientists-needed/">compete
fiercely</a>, because the demand for data scientists is skyrocketing
throughout industry, research, and government. But until basic
analyses become cheap and universal, records in most institutions will
still keep their secrets locked inside. Furthermore, health providers
will have to realize that, in an environment of declining payments and
of demands that providers show value for what they do, they urgently
need these analytics.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Patient control

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

No one benefits as much as patients from the convenience and
predictive power of electronic records. As we'll see, patient control
is not only feasible but a key to treatment and research.

</p>

</dd>

</dl>

Part of rethinking electronic health systems and their effects on the
doctor/patient experience is to express the value of the digital
systems to people entering all that data. Even if administrators and
public health agencies get good data and analyze it to lower costs and
improve population health--something that is barely starting yet--the
doctors and patients who are interacting with the system will lack
sympathy for those goals and experience nothing but the frustration
and demands created by the system. Effective interaction requires a
system design that benefits the end-users, gets their consent for
system use, and makes the benefits clear to them. This is all the more
reason to open up electronic record systems and bring them into
patient life--the goal of coordinated care, which we'll look at next.

<a name="coordinated_care">
<h2>Coordinated care: teams and telehealth</h2>
</a>

<p>

The current health doctrine--honored more often in words than in
deeds--views people not as patients encountering the health care
system through a set of discrete visits, but as full human beings
needing lifelong attention. Indeed, this is the only way to treat
chronic conditions, which are the health concerns of affluent
nations. (As countries' wealth increases, their health problems change
from predominantly acute conditions such as infections to chronic
conditions such as heart failure and diabetes, a shift called an
"epidemiological transition.") These conditions--lung cancer, liver
cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease--are also called
"lifestyle" diseases. Now, there are plenty of chronic diseases that
we don't blame on the life choices of the victims--such as autoimmune
disease--but these conditions still respond strongly to individual
behavioral choices and need to be managed in people's daily lives.

</p>

<p>

Therefore, researchers urge doctors to adopt a "systems perspective"
in medical care. Viewing a patient as a system that constantly adapts
to a changing environment can help a great deal in the long-term
planning required for today's chronic conditions. And the patient's
"system" includes not only her body, but her mental attitude, desires,
and fears. Systems thinking also places a patient within a family and
a community, which is crucial to effecting change. Living or working
where lots of people smoke cigarettes, for instance, not only exposes
a person to second-hand smoke but weakens their resolve to stay away
from cigarettes.

</p>

<p>

Health care itself is also a system, as I mentioned at the start of
this article. And it helps not only to view a clinic or hospital as a
system, but to see the treatment team that surrounds each patients as
one. Indeed, the patient's relationship with a single physician is no
longer enough. The physician must integrate tightly with other staff
who deal with the patient--all the more since nowadays, given the
doctor
shortage, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304899704579389203539061082">nurse
practitioners and physician assistants do more</a> in the sphere
previously reserved for doctors. The system must also broaden to
include the patient herself. Health IT tools can pull patient,
physician, and other experts such as physical therapists, social
workers, and nutritionists into a functioning team.

<p>

As a concrete example of the need for coordinated care,
<a href="http://www.hospitalemrandehr.com/2014/02/24/whats-the-real-cause-of-hospital-readmissions">the
preponderance of hospital readmissions come from nursing and long-term
care facilities</a>, and could probably be reduced by better exchanges
of information.

</p>

<p>

Despite the increasing focus on chronic illness by health
professionals, acute diseases still require prompt attention. The
risk of epidemics grows with the concentration of people into large
cities and their greater mobility, as a
<a href="http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/health/245375571.html">recent
international initiative shows</a>. That article mentions the use of
motorcycles to report incidents. Digital technology can combine
reports from individuals over mobile networks, data analysis, and
coordination among health responders to deal with acute break-outs.

</p>

<p>

A consortium of providers trying to avert the need for hospital
admissions have formalized patient/clinician relationships in
the <a href="http://pcmh.ahrq.gov">patient centered medical home</a>
(PCMH),
which <a href="http://ahier.blogspot.com/2009/10/patient-centered-medical-home.html">covers
new options in treatment, monitoring, and reimbursement</a>. Patient
engagement in the home doesn't require fancy technology: it could be
achieved through follow-up phone calls and visits. But digital
technologies can make the care less expensive and more responsive. The
burden on both patients and caregivers can be lightened a great deal
through technology, whether it's simple reports by a patient via phone
or sensors that track such things as whether she is moving around the
house, how her weight changes each day, and whether she takes her
medication.

</p>
<p>

Many PCMH initiatives depend on close human contact such as visiting
nurses, with minimal technology. Simple things like
<a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3026443/this-simple-kit-redesigns-childrens-health-records-so-they-actually-work">card-holding
sleeves</a> can help patients and health workers coordinate their
work.

</p>
<p>

Studies show
that <a href="http://www.hitconsultant.net/2013/09/11/rhode-island-patient-centered-medical-home-pilot-reduces-ed-visits/">these
innovations reduce hospital admissions for chronically ill
patients</a>, and particularly
<a href="http://www.pcpcc.org/sites/default/files/1658_McCarthy_care_transitions_synthesis_v2.pdf">readmissions
within 30 days after being discharged from a hospital</a>, a measure
that has excited hospital administrators ever since the Centers for
Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) started in 2012 to penalize hospitals
for such readmissions.
On the other hand, like many health initiatives, the PCMH savings could
<a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2014/02/data-medical-home-high-costs-benefit.html">get
suctioned up by the bureaucratic costs for compliance and
reporting</a>.

</p>

<p>

Still, one would hope for better
evidence <a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2014/02/shocking-lack-data-medical-home.html">than
we have so far</a> that this form of patient engagement improves
outcomes. It may be that we don't know what works yet, or are applying
techniques inconsistently. Whatever we can do to keep patients in
their homes will contribute considerably to improved quality of life
and reduce costs by holding off their use of assisted care
facilities. As we've seen, making the patient feel like an empowered
partner, rather than a disparaged target of snooping, is key to
success.

</p>
<p>

What comes after the PCMH? Naturally,
the <a href="http://www.govhealthit.com/news/cms-funded-medical-neighborhood-pilot-launch-month">patient-centered
medical neighborhood</a>, which uses data about all patients in a
clinician's practice to draw conclusions about public health. This
local use of data, however, just hints at the power released by
integrating data across societies, a theme we'll explore more under
<a href="#aco_integrated">accountable care organizations</a>.

</p>

<p>

Telehealth--a term I'll use in preference to telemedicine, which
evokes a narrower range of activities--allows experts anywhere in the
world to weigh in on diagnosis. In many poor areas of the world
lacking doctors, a patient can take a picture of a condition with a
cell phone and sends it to a doctor for evaluation. More commonly, a
patient or doctor contacts the expert over an Internet video
hook-up. Social networks among doctors, which allow them to share
stories and ask for expert advice, may also fall under the umbrella of
telehealth.

</p>

<p>

Now we need to consider some of the mechanics behind IT in health. One
requirement--electronic data exchange--looms behind nearly all the
advances being promoted: clinical research, patient empowerment,
sensor data, telehealth, and more. The health field needs the same
flexible, powerful capability for data exchange available to other
organizations nowadays to carry out business and research
collaborations. <a href="http://www.hospitalemrandehr.com/2014/01/31/can-major-change-come-from-just-internal-hospital-data">There
is not much to learn from the data collected by any single
hospital</a>, so the institutions have to learn to create large,
combined data sets. They also need to incorporate the data streams
created by all the consumer devices described earlier.

</p>
<p>

Without data exchange:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Sensors are mostly useless--they cannot forward their information to a
central storage point.

</li>

<li>

Clinical research is restricted to what a single lab can do on its
own. This limitation is throttling modern pharmaceutical companies and
academic researchers, who are running out of assets to carry out
increasingly expensive trials on their own.

</li>

<li>

Patient engagement shrivels, because patients cannot learn what their
doctors know about them or share information among providers.

</li>

<li>

Telehealth is blind, and becomes essentially impossible.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

But the two technologies that permit electronic data exchange in most
fields are crippled in the health care field. Only in the past year or
two have breakthroughs been made, and they are far from being put in
place across health providers:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

Formats

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

In digital media, the format defines how bits are laid out so that
someone can write a document on one side and someone else can read it
on the other. In electronic health records, HL7 is the current state
of the art in standards for representing patient records, but it does
not provide unified formats; there are too many loopholes for putting
data in odd places or defining proprietary fields. Furthermore,
attempts to adapt to a semi-modern convention were done by translating
a rather ill-structured older formats of documents into XML, failing
to produce valid XML and therefore leaving the documents hard to parse
with standard XML tools.

</p>
<p>

The Consolidated-Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) in 2011
finally provided a more standard format supporting a wide range of
clinical documents, and it was adopted as a requirement for supporting
Meaningful Use. It is a complex format (taking up a 576-page draft
specification) and still allows for proprietary extensions, a
concession that is probably necessary to promote innovation.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Exchange protocols

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

In digital transmissions, protocols are the standards for opening and
closing connections, authenticating and authorizing correspondents,
and mechanisms needed to create and maintain communication. The first
standard protocol defined in the health care
field, <a href="http://www.connectopensource.org">CONNECT</a>, began
as a government effort as late as 2008 and uses complicated elements
such as SAML
(see <a href="http://www.connectopensource.org/blog/2012-04-04-0000/how-did-we-implement-nationwide-health-information-network-specifications">the
CONNECT site</a>) and UDDI
(see <a href="http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/workshops/SOA-HC/presentations-10/13_E1_Riley.pdf">pages
12-13 of this PDF</a>). Similarly complex SOAP
technologies <a href="http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=XDS.b_Implementation">underlie
the data exchange standard</a> used by institutions to share health
records.

</p>

<p>

Now the government is pulling the health care field behind two much
more feasible
standards, <a href="http://wiki.directproject.org/">Direct</a> for
secure message exchange and
<a href="http://www.directtrust.org/">DirectTrust</a> for creating an
infrastructure that validates the users on each side of the exchange.
These do not guarantee, however, that doctors (and much less patients)
can exchange records,
because <a href="http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2014/02/01/teach-your-emr-to-do-email-impossible-maybe-not/">established
organizations may block attempts at authentication</a>.

</p>

</dd>

</dl>

<p>

Current standards have by no means solved the data exchange problem.
The C-CDA is designed for the exchange of large documents, as the D in
its name suggests. But as people collect data from devices and send
them to doctors, they need protocols and formats appropriate for tiny,
frequent transmissions.

</p>

<p>

Security hangs over every development in the storage and exchange of
patient data. While the Direct project focuses on email and the Web
for secure data exchange, several commercial solutions try to solve
the problem of sending secure messages among mobile devices, even
"ephemeral messages" that get deleted after being viewed.

</p>

<p>

A robust electronic system would allow patients to share some parts of
their records but not others--for instance, letting an orthopedist see
records related to sports injuries but not mental health. This
flexibility, known as <em>data segmentation</em>, has received widely
endorsements in the field but also many criticisms, including from EHR
vendors who decry the complexity it would add to their products and
from physicians who are afraid they'll be liable for data to which
they were denied access. Still, support for segmentation appears in a
major 2010 recommendation on health records by the President's Council
of Advisors on Science and Technology (see the section "Privacy
Protection of Metadata-Tagged Data Elements" on pp. 51-52 of
the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-health-it-report.pdf">report</a>).

</p>

<a name="hie">
<h3>Health information exchanges</h3>
</a>

<p>

The Internet permits any two sites using the same protocol to exchange
data, a convenience we take advantage of hundreds of times a day. Why
shouldn't health data be exchanged just as easily? This is the goal of
health information exchange (HIE), a term referring both to the act of
sharing records and to institutions who exist solely to facilitate
that exchange.

</p>

<p>

The security of sensitive patient data is a concern here. Drilled into
anxious administrators by HIPAA and other laws, a concern for security
has often been cited as an excuse for refusing to use HIE. But
security shouldn't be any more of a problem than it is for financial
information or sensitive corporate secrets. Despite recurring security
compromises, banking and industry depend on digital exchange. Indeed,
clinicians use the Internet all the time for billing, the transmission
of medical images, and other communications; it's only treatment for
patients that gets short shrift.

</p>

<p>

HIE has historically been tied up with expensive organizations that
specialize in this area, which is like having to go to a special
online broker to place your book order at Amazon.com. Because doctors
had little incentive to give away the information they gathered about
a patient, these organizations usually lasted only as long as a state
agency,
the <a href="http://www.hospitalemrandehr.com/2014/01/29/nyc-health-systems-get-7m-to-share-data">US
government</a>, or some other outside funder was willing to pour
millions of dollars into them. HIEs depended on proprietary software
and offered little added value over a fax machine. Worst of all, they
violated patient trust by selling data, taking advantage of a loophole
in
HIPAA. <a href="http://ehrintelligence.com/2013/12/20/health-information-exchange-grew-by-leaps-and-bounds-in-2013/">Recent
efforts to rescue the concept</a> still don't promise long-term
viability.

</p>

<p>

The very existence of HIEs was predicated on two problems: the
difficulty of translating documents between formats, and the
difficulty of matching patients. Each EHR vendor presented data in a
different format, as we have seen. Thus, to serve hospitals
using <em>N</em> different vendors, an HIE would either
need <em>N</em><sup>2</sup> forms of translation software or develop
its own internal format, along with 2<em>N</em> programs to translate
their format to and from the format used by each vendor. A hospital may pay
specialized vendors tens of millions of dollars just to
integrate systems within its own institution.

</p>

<p>

The United States, unlike many countries, has no unique, universal
identifier for residents. Although states are officially supposed to
implement the REAL ID act of 2005 in their ID cards, public concerns
over identity theft and surveillance have kept the government from
enforcing the law. Therefore, clinicians and HIEs use up to 17
different identifiers (such as name, address, age, and birth date) to
figure out whether a patient seen by one hospital is currently at
another. A <a href="http://www.ihe.net/technical_framework/upload/ihe_iti_suppl_pix_pdq_hl7v3_rev2-1_ti_2010-08-10.pdf">153-page
specification</a> defines
the <a href="http://www.openempi.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2654507">Patient
Demographic Query and Patient Identifier Cross-Reference standards</a>
that institutions use to ask about the presence of patients and make
the
match. <a href="http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/blogs/what-hios-can-learn-from-the-onc-patient-matching-report-47152-1.html">Mistakes
often lead to loss of life.</a>

</p>
<p>

The US government is working on a voluntary identification system
call <a href="http://www.nist.gov/nstic/">Trusted Identities in
Cyberspace (NSTIC)</a>, based on certificates not much different from
those that validate web sites, but the system is far from ready.

</p>
<p>

All this groaning infrastructure is a way to avoid a simple solution:
leaving data in patient hands. The patient would just point a doctor
to her online records before a visit. Professional services would crop
up to help patients who don't want to manage their own records. To
cope with rare occasions when a patient is incoherent or unconscious
(fears raised repeatedly by professionals opposed to patient control
over data), patients could carry emergency phone numbers for relatives
or other agents to whom they have granted access their to records.
Smartcards have also been proposed to hold critical patient
information, or login information for their online records.

</p>
<p>

Recent changes in the field have led to slightly better prospects for
HIE:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

The CONNECT and Direct protocols discussed
in <a href="#coordinated_care">the section on data exchange</a>, once
they were supported by EHR vendors, allowed clinicians and HIEs to
dispense with some of the complicated translation software they
previously needed.

</li>

<li>

Some HIEs realize they must provide more value than simply shuttling
data between health care providers. These more forward-looking
organizations typically provide patient stratification to their
clients, using their knowledge of patient diagnoses to identify
at-risk patients. These are the key contributions of
the <a href="http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/beacon-community-program">Beacon
Communities</a> set up by the government as testbeds for modern,
coordinated care.

</li>

<li>

Software vendors are providing various solutions to exchange and
interoperability problems, often in middleware that an EHR vendor can
use.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Yet despite these
advances, <a href="http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/hie-survey-offers-sobering-results-on-value-47151-1.html">few
HIEs are surviving</a>. It is time to remove them from the equation
and use standards such as Direct to enable data exchange between
doctor and patient, or between doctors under the control of the
patient. Unable to get health information exchange universally
available, payers are trying a different route to paying doctors for
the value they provide, a principle known as accountable care.

</p>

<a name="aco_integrated">
<h3>Accountable care organizations and other integrated care</h3>
</a>

<p>

Most developed countries take responsibility for their entire
populations over long periods of time, and therefore have frameworks
that potentially can handle (even if imperfectly implemented)
integrated, long-term treatments of chronic conditions. Such health
systems exist in the United States as well--the Department of Veterans
Affairs and Kaiser Permanente, mentioned earlier, and the Indian
Health Services--but most US residents get care episodically by
doctors, hospitals, and insurers, who do not commit to long-term
responsibility for the patient's health or collect data over long
periods of time.

</p>

<p>

The biggest upheaval in American health care in the 2010s decade may
be the attempt by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services
(CMS) to reorganize hospitals and clinics into consortia with
comprehensive responsibility for patients'
health. Called <a href="www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ACO">accountable
care organizations</a>, it encourages clinics and hospitals to combine
and offer complete services to patients--in short, to act more like
the Department of Veterans Affairs.

</p>

<p>

CMS encourages ACOs to reduce costs through incentives that work
against the old toxic model of paying for each visit. Each patient in
a certain category (such as certain types of heart disease) is assumed
to cost a certain amount to treat. The ACO is rewarded for keeping
costs below this threshold. The plan is a step toward global payments,
which pay the health provider a fixed sum to take care of a defined
population.

</p>

<p>

The payment and policy issues created by this situation lie beyond the
scope of this article, but we can certainly look at the IT that would
be required by an integrated health system.

</p>

<p>

Determining how much a particular patient should "cost" is a difficult
judgment that requires better data than we have now. Furthermore, the
three-year period for which an ACO is considered responsible for a
patient may not be long enough to see improvements in chronic
conditions. But the problems with ACOs go deeper.

</p>

<p>

Few ACOs have been set up yet. CMS presents early evidence that
<a href="http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/cms-medicare-medicaid-acos-are-saving-money-47194-1.html">ACOs
are saving money</a>, probably by picking off the low-hanging
fruit. (Without technological
razzle-dazzle, <a href="http://iom.edu/~/media/Files/Perspectives-Files/2013/Commentaries/VSRT-ValueBasedCare.pdf">Blue
Cross Blue Shield also announced significant cost savings from
value-based care</a>.) A successful ACO meets
the <a href="http://www.ihi.org/offerings/Initiatives/TripleAim/Pages/default.aspx">"triple
aim"</a> in health care--improving the patient experience, achieving
better health, and lowering costs--through such data-rich activities
as:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Tracking the patient from primary care to specialist to hospital to
physical therapist and so on, making sure the patient follows up on
recommended treatments.

</li>

<li>

Sharing a patient's records expeditiously among all the clinicians
working with the patient.

</li>

<li>

Crunching data about patient conditions and outcomes to find where
treatments succeed or fail.

</li>

<li>

Using this longitudinal data to predict trends, which could help
apportion resources more efficiently and even contributes to public
health.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

In the best case, fixed payments and rigorously monitored
outcomes--both are necessary to make the ACO work--will inspire
providers to look for efficiencies.

</p>

<p>

The activities just listed show that, essentially, to be successful,
an ACO has to exchange data seamlessly as the patient moves through
its system.
<a href="http://ehrintelligence.com/2014/02/17/what-tools-are-needed-for-managing-population-health/">Three
elements</a> have been identified to summarize ACO needs: analytics,
workflow, and communication, all of which depend on an integrated
health IT system. One might think of ACOs as bringing health
information exchange within the boundaries of the cooperating
providers. As we have seen, current EHR systems are not capable of
seamless exchange.

</p>

<p>

ACOs are also at constant risk because a patient has the right to get
care from someone outside the ACO. They need powerful incentives to
keep each patient within their system.

</p>

<p>

Applying scrutiny to the needs and problems faced by ACOs reveals that
these problems are best solved on a more global level; most individual
ACOs lacks the wherewithal to solve it themselves. In particular:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>

Data exchange requires robust, easy-to-implement standards that should
be reached at a national or even international level. To glom together
local hospitals and clinics into ACO and expect them to harmonize
their record systems is too much to ask. The problems of current ACOs
show
how <a href="http://ehrintelligence.com/2014/01/22/what-do-acos-reveal-about-the-importance-of-integration/">integration
through data sharing is both critical and hard for them to
achieve</a>.

</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>

Decision support and public health are facilitated by huge data
sets. The more institutions combine to exchange data, the more they
can learn. As we shall see, a national public health plan could be
built on data stored by patients and shared at their discretion.
Although some individual hospitals have learned valuable lessons by
tracking their own data, and Kaiser Permanente has achieved a lot by
exploiting its huge size, a national health system would generate far
better data than the amount an ACO can collect.

</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>

A perennial complaint of health reformers has been the isolation of
data and decision making by individual doctors and institutions--data
silos, as they are called. ACOs just create bigger silos needing
standards for data sharing and interoperability. The system seems to
be an attempt to ward off the solutions that would enable health
information exchange throughout the health care system.

</p>

<p>

ACOs also
risk <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-18/bigger-hospitals-mean-higher-prices-not-better-care.html">raising
costs by creating larger, more powerful players</a>, a risk CMS is
apparently willing to take in the hope that better coordination in the
long run will lower costs. I consider ACOs an experiment whose lessons
can be eventually applied in a national plan for data exchange and
coordinated care.

</p>

<a name="telehealth">
<h3>Telehealth</h3>
</a>

<p>

This buzzword has been applied broadly to many aspects of health
care. Examples include:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Contacts by phone or text messages to remind patients of basic
treatments, such as coming to doctor's appointments or taking their
medications. Rudimentary technologies can be used in very
sophisticated ways. For instance, recruiting a family member to text a
patient may produce a better outcome than receiving an impersonal text
message from the
clinic. <a href="https://app.preventnow.com/how_it_works">Prevent</a>
goes even farther, linking people at risk for diabetes with coaches
and other participants over a mobile device.

</li>

<li>

Remote consultations. These may take place between a patient and a
doctor, or between a doctor and a specialist. Although the use of
video connections for mental health treatment was disparaged for a
long time, <a href="http://www.hsrd.research.va.gov/publications/forum/oct10/oct10-5.cfm">many patients find it helpful.

</li>

<li>

Contacts with patients in their own
homes, <a href="#individual_home">discussed earlier</a>.

</li>

<li>

The high end of telehealth is
the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18305328">remote
monitoring of ICU patients</a>, which sounds sub-optimal but
can <a href="http://www.ihealthbeat.org/articles/2013/12/6/study-icu-telehealth-use-can-boost-survival-rates-speed-discharge">actually
do better by patients than depending on staff in the unit</a>.
Intensive care units are laden with sensors, which can be monitored by
experts outside the center just as easily as by nurses on the
floor. Technology now also allows remote monitoring of trauma patients
while they're being brought in from the scene of the trauma.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Remote medicine changes the health equation for people living in areas
underserved by doctors, such as rural areas and developing
nations. Ordinary residents of poor areas, even children, can be
taught to run phone apps that walk them through questions to help
determine what is wrong with a patient. They can also take photos of
afflicted areas of the body and send them to doctors in cities better
served by clinics. One example is a
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-25986841">modified mobile
phone</a> that can take pictures of the eye</a>.

</p>

<p>

Many applications of telemedicine simply extend the reach of a doctor,
not much different from placing a telephone call. These applications
conform to a traditional model of health care, albeit with some
convenience for the patient and notable cost savings. But truly
transformative telehealth involves a large set of the technologies we
have examined for collecting, exchanging, and analyzing data.

</p>

<p>

Payment models need to change drastically to accommodate telehealth.
Currently, most payers won't even reimburse a doctor for using email
or the telephone to advise a patient instead of a visit to the
office. But <a href="http://www.americantelemed.org/docs/default-source/policy/state-telemedicine-legislation-matrix.pdf">many
states are preparing legislation to allow telemedicine</a>, a
<a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/new-bill-breaks-down-telehealth-barriers">bill
introduced into Congress</a> would promote consultations with doctors
over state lines, and
a <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/820009">more
comprehensive health reform bill<a/> endorses telehealth. Because
doctors are comfortable initiating consultations and patients in
underserved areas crave contact with professionals, telehealth should
become very popular once the enabling factors are in place.

</p>


<a name="coordinated_care_barrier">
<h3>Barriers to coordinated care</h3>
</a>

<p>

The main barriers to data exchange are institutional decisions.
Hospital and clinic administrators know that making data portable will
ease the way for patients to find other providers, should they choose
to do so. ACOs, like bilateral or regional trade treaties, are formed
to preserve competitive advantages over outsiders. EHR vendors
undermine interoperable standards (to the point of lobbying on
relevant legislation and regulation) for the sake of their clients as
well as to preserve barriers to entry in their own markets.
Pharmaceutical companies and clinical researchers guard secrets to
further their careers. And even though HIPAA requires data sharing,
health providers like to claim that they can't release data because of
HIPAA.

</p>

<p>

But even accounting for all those considerations, we also have to
acknowledge technical barriers to health information exchange and
consequently to coordinated care.

</p>

<ul>

<li>

As explained under <a href="#ehr_barrier">barriers to using data</a>,
people are inherently variable, so data exchange could be comparing
apples to oranges.

</li>

<li>

Data collected by researchers is just as variable as data from medical
records. One researcher will collect data under different temperatures
or other conditions from a researcher next door, or divide the data
into different categories.

</li>

<li>

Errors are rife in medical records, whether on paper or in the
computer. It has been estimated that everybody's record has
errors. (Try
reading <a href="http://bakersdozenandapolloxiv.com/2014/02/18/medical-record-errors/">one
person's account, plus some of the comments</a>.) These weaken the
validity of conclusions reached through data processing. Statisticians
and data scientists have developed algorithms to compensate for
suspicious data fields, which makes the data more usable in the
aggregate. But algorithms don't actually correct the data, which needs
the patient's eye.

</li>

<li>

Good equipment for telehealth can be expensive. Bandwidth for video
hook-ups, for instance, is not universally available. And although an
image may be sent to a clinician's cell phone, the phone's screen
probably lacks sufficient resolution to show the necessary detail.

</li>

<li>

Clinicians resent the time taken up by reporting requirements, such as
checking hemoglobin A1c for diabetic patients. A tension will probably
always exist between offering immediate treatment for a patient in the
office and providing statistics for valuable longitudinal analytics.
Technology should reduce some of that tension by automatically
extracting the necessary reports and verifying their accuracy.

</li>

<li>

Segmentation may turn out to be a mirage, even if the considerable
technical hurdles are overcome. For instance, if a patient asked the
doctor to segment his diagnosis and treatment for an STD, the doctor
would have to properly tag everything from the clinical interview and
the lab test to the diagnostic code and the medication assigned. It's
too easy for a lab test or medication list to give away the truth,
even if a diagnosis is hidden.

</li>

</ul>

<a name="engagement_games">
<h2>Patient empowerment</h2>
</a>

<p>

Everything we've seen in health IT advances so far point to a bigger
role for individuals in their own health care. Health experts like to
talk about "patient engagement" or "patient satisfaction,"
condescending terms that suggest the doctor has all the answers but
needs to make stupid or recalcitrant patients comply. Patient
advocates prefer the term "patient empowerment" and replace
"compliance" with "adherence." The very term "patient," reeking of
passivity and helplessness, irks some advocates,
but <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2013/05/the-elusive-quest-to-transform-healthcare-through-patient-empowerment.html">other
terms such "consumer" have problems too</a>.

</p>

<p>

The psychological, organizational, and policy implications of patient
empowerment (or even engagement) are huge, but this article focuses on
the role of computing and data. How can health IT help move care to
its new locus, the individual? We have already discussed
patient-centered medical homes, Quantified Self, and openings in
clinical_research, but less obvious changes can suffuse patient
empowerment through the health care field.

</p>

<a name="without_doctor">
<h3>Health care without a doctor</h3>
</a>

<p>

Insensitive doctors sometimes act as if the patient was not a factor.
People are turning the tables now, engaging in many health-related
activities without involving clinicians. And today's technology is
replete with playthings and baubles for the motivated
individual--often acting in collaboration with peers. The technologies
can bring real benefits.

</p>

<p>

For instance, a number of mobile
apps <a href="http://www.fiercehealthit.com/special-reports/7-health-technologies-veterans-mobile-apps">help
veterans manage stress and mood<a>, while several apps such
as <a href="http://stompstaging.telus-nas.com/FAQ.aspx">STOMP</a>
offer regular encouragement to tobacco smokers who want to quit.
Games improving brain performance are a particularly popular niche.
Sites such
as <a href="http://about.onehealth.com/howitworks/">OneHealth</a>
and <a href="http://www.proteus.com/todays-products/for-professionals/">Helius</a>
are broader and more strategic, setting up plans for patients to
follow in their daily lives.

</p>

<p>

People often use social networking sites with which they are already
familiar, such as Facebook, to form communities around health issues.
Others choose specialized sites such as PatientsLikeMe. People can
even <a href="https://www.hulahq.com/">share test results with
potential sexual partners</a> to provide assurances that they are free
of STDs.

</p>

<p>

The entrenched conservatism of the health care industry have driven
many, such as the illustrious chronicler of "disruptive innovation,"
Clayton Christensen, to suggest that change will be forced on the
health care industry from outside. These reformers will celebrate as
the metaphorical countryside advances on the city. But disruption is
not a total solution, because someone must still provide the knee
surgeries, the colonoscopies, and the other major procedures and tests
that more and more of us demand. And disruption cannot ignore the
imperative of coordinating long-range individual behavior. Perhaps
outside organizations can disrupt health care, but only if they move
beyond "urgent care" or walk-in clinics to care for the whole person
over a period spanning decades.

</p>

<a name="gamification">
<h3>Gamification</h3>
</a>

<p>

One exciting area of health research is
the <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/06/games-for-health-covers-curren.html">use
of video games</a>. All types of games can be impressed into service
in the pursuit of better health: mental challenges, role-playing games
(for clinicians as well as patients), competitions, and even the old
stand-by: first person shooter games.

</p>

<p>

A game is an automated form of patient engagement, along the lines of
text messages reminding them to take their medication, but infinitely
more powerful. No one has to ask a patient to be engaged; with a game
he chooses to be so.

</p>

<p>

It may not be surprising that games can ameliorate mental conditions
such as Attention Deficit Disorder or Post-Traumatic Stress
Syndrome. Perhaps more thought-provoking is their role in helping
<a href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/candy-crush-stroke-patients">stroke
victims</a> and cancer patients recover.
The <a href="http://rockhealth.com/2013/07/games-for-health-the-latest/">combination
of games and devices</a> creates a whole new playing field for medical
research. For some people, games outperform medications in every way,
proving in some conditions to
be <a href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/gamification-secret-cutting-care-costs-mHealth-mobile">cheaper</a>,
more effective, less dangerous, longer-lasting in their effects--and
of course more fun.

</p>

<p>

Why do people love games? Several explanations have been raised,
including the story-telling suggested by a game and the way it makes
people feel they're in control. The feeling of control is a bit odd,
because every detail presented to them on the screen--assuming it's a
video game--has been planned and programmed. In any case, games feel
like the ultimate in putting the patient in control. Games also make
maximum use of feedback loops, which people use in all areas of life
(and health) to encourage positive thinking and behavior.

</p>

<p>

Finally, many games are social. One can compete with others for
achievements and at the same time feel spurred on by their support and
cameraderie to make behavior changes.

</p>

<a name="transparency">
<h3>Transparency</h3>
</a>

<p>

Economists and other observers of the health care industry have
understood <a href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/82/2/PHCBP.pdf">as
far back as 1963</a> that it is not a true market. Many wish that it
was one--a level playing field where patients knew the costs of care,
the quality of the provider, and all their options. But in the United
States, all too often:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Not even the provider knows how much a patient will pay until the
insurance payer issues a statement, often after the procedure has
taken place. Prices are set in secret negotiations between providers
and insurers and vary among patients.

</li>

<li>

Hospitals conceal the rate of complications, rehospitalizations, and
deaths from procedures, and even though governments often collect such
information, they rarely publicize it so that patients can compare
doctors. <a href="http://capsules.kaiserhealthnews.org/index.php/2014/01/expensive-hospitals-strong-reputations-but-little-evidence-of-better-care-study-finds/">Reputation
is a poor guide to actual quality</a>. To top off the problem, patient
ratings are mostly irrelevant, being based more on the quality of the
food or the amount of noise in the corridor (not that these are
unimportant) than the success or failure of procedures.

</li>

<li>

Physicians try to present alternative treatments (including the
alternative of no treatment) to patients, but it's hard to predict the
relative success of each treatment. Genetic analysis can often
indicate what will work for a particular patient. Many new treatments
come along that doctors aren't aware of. The success rate of more
experimental treatments may be unknown.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Governments have started
<a href="https://data.medicare.gov/Nursing-Home-Compare/Quality-Measures-Short-Stay/u8my-ac5x">releasing
data about hospital quality</a>, and some intrepid sites such
as <a href="http://clearhealthcosts.com/">Clear Health Costs</a> use
public data sets and crowdsourcing to build support for patients
trying to compare
costs. <a href="http://www.castlighthealth.com/solutions/">Castlight</a>
includes health cost and quality measures as part of a service to
employers. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303650204579375242842086688">Pressure is rising</a> for more price reporting.

<p>

Observers have worried that making prices public will actually lead
some facilities to raise prices. But when the day comes that everyone
can see the price and outcome of popular procedures, the market will
take over and crush institutions guilty of bad care or overcharging.
Posting prices clearly might also cut down on some of fraud that
officials guess adds up to
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/merrillmatthews/2012/05/31/medicare-and-medicaid-fraud-is-costing-taxpayers-billions/2/">as
much as sixty billion dollars per year</a> for Medicare alone.

<h3>Patient control over data</h3>
</a>

<p>

What have we seen about patients in our tour through modern health
care in this article? That patients can benefit from the output of
sensors and monitoring, which is by definition their own data. That
electronic records are the basis of better care, but are most secure
and available when the patient has control over them. When you think
about it, patient empowerment is meaningless without patient control
over data.

</p>

<p>

As mentioned earlier, doctors routinely ignore the legal requirement
to show patients their health records. Institutions affiliated
with <a href="http://www.myopennotes.org/what-is-opennotes-2/">OpenNotes</a>
offer patients ready access to all their data (including their
doctors' notes) through patient
portals. <a href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1363511">They
found that this provides several clinically important
advantages</a>. For instance, patients report taking their prescribed
medications more often. But patient portals remain clunky at
best. While they are evolving rapidly, they're still a long way from
being as empowering as records that patients maintain themselves.

</p>

<p>

Two major projects have offered patients a place to keep their own
health records: Google Health and
<a href="https://www.healthvault.com/">Microsoft
HealthVault</a>. Google closed its service because it wasn't taking
off, and adopters of HealthVault are also fairly sparse. Many
explanations for these lackluster results have circulated. Some claim
the services were difficult to use or lacked important features, some
cited a lack of appeal to patients (including worries about
breaches of privacy), and some noted resistance put up by physicians,
providers, and payers, who feel threatened by patient-owned data and
want control for their own financial benefit. In any case, it's clear
something big has to change
to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gpk-fbfg4Y">give patients
their damn data (video)</a>.

</p>

<p>

One feature of the winning electronic health system is sure to be free
software, which already offers several promising developments:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

<a href="http://indivohealth.org/">Indivo</a> to store data

</dt>

<dd>

An inspiration for Google Health and an actual source of some of
HealthVault's source code, Indivo is a free software personal health
record. It
includes <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/06/clinician-researcher-and-patie.html">an
API to let other EHRs upload data to it</a>--but no simple way to
download data in bulk, because the developers' goal is leave data
under the patient's control.

</dd>

<dt>

<a href="http://www.healthit.gov/bluebutton">Blue Button</a> to
download data from EHRs

</dt>

<dd>

This project, the brainchild of the Department of Veterans Affairs,
has become a standard for the whole health industry. When Blue Button
started, the project was simplicity itself: a patient could press a
button on the health provider's web site and receive a down-and-dirty,
plain text list of his conditions, treatments, and other facts. A more
structured XML format has now been developed to make the data
friendlier for apps as well as human readers, and it's eminently
usable for OpenNotes.

</dd>

<dt>

<a href="http://wiki.directproject.org/">Direct</a> for data exchange

</dt>

<dd>

Introduced in the <a href="#coordinated_care">data exchange section of
this article</a>, Direct makes secure exchange of patient data
possible even if both sides have nothing more sophisticated than
email. Because encrypted email is so rare, most users will have to
contract with a web site to protect the transmission, but the web site
already plays a key role by authenticating the person with whom they
want to exchange data.

</dd>

</dl>

<p>

Health providers are gradually putting data in the cloud to reduce
costs, improve security, and make access easier, so there is no reason
the records shouldn't be under the control of the patient instead of
the provider. Smart cards, which have been used in France and other
countries for many years, may also work in tandem with personal health
records, making it
<a href="http://www.healthitoutcomes.com/doc/a-strong-case-for-smart-cards-in-healthcare-0001">easy for patients to bring their data to many health
providers</a>.

</p>

<p>

But even if someone weaves all these technologies into an appealing
and usable patient record, how can patients be encouraged to use the
records, and doctors encouraged to consult them? The key to progress
returns, perhaps, to the very first element of health reform listed in
this article: sensors worn by patients to preserve their observations
of daily living. Such data could grow in value to become
indispensable, whereupon doctors and their EHRs will have to open up
to patient-maintained records.

</p>

<p>

Several leading health IT groups have
<a href="http://mobihealthnews.com/27825/industry-groups-to-hhs-include-patient-generated-data-in-mu-stage-3/">asked
the Department of Health and Human Services</a> to require health
providers to accept patient data in Stage 3 of Meaningful Use. But
because consumer devices report their results to data silos maintained
by the device's vendor, the patient must also be able to run a simple
program to capture the data, either from the device or from the
vendor's site.

</p>

<p>

When patients insert data into records, encoding them with
a <em>provenance</em> becomes even more important. It's always
valuable to know how data was obtained, but doctors are particularly
cautious about measurements that were taken outside the clinical
setting.

</p>

<p>

Patients have <a href="http://reginaholliday.blogspot.com/">been
advocating for access to their records for many decades</a>, but
technology is finally emerging to back up their demands. This article
has hopefully suggested some of the significant advances that the
health care field can make when their demands are met.

</p>

<a name="closing">
<h2>General closing thoughts</h2>
</a>

<p>

It's no coincidence that President Obama--along with many other
presidents
from <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/3/399.full">Harry
Truman</a>
through <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~starr/20starr.html">Bill
Clinton</a>--made health care reform central to his administration.
Americans are facing multiple health crises, whether from the effects
of obesity or the tragedy of drug addiction. Health costs are
bankrupting the nation--when people talk about the federal deficit,
they are largely referring to Medicare's expected payouts. And
Americans are just plain terrified by the prospect of getting sick and
not being able to get treatment.

</p>

<p>

And although the United States spends far more than other nations for
health, without commensurate outcomes, the problems are not limited to
this country. The ratio of elderly to working-age people throughout
the world is increasing as their incomes and life opportunities
expand, while breakthroughs in treatments raise expectations for care.

</p>

<p>

Caution among payers, providers, and administrators toward disruptive
innovation is understandable. People can get hurt if something goes
wrong, and decades of fail-safe practices to protect patients have
been built up that put a damper on experimentation.

</p>

<p>

It is not within the scope of this article to discuss health care
policy. As for fears that the Affordable Care Act will raise costs,
I'll simply say--if you provide people with health insurance but don't
actually make them healthier, no doubt costs will go up.

</p>

<p>

Thus, regardless of the fate of the ACA or of political controversies,
it is critical for societies to make use of available data and
computer technologies. Patients must get their data and must be
encouraged to provide it to researchers. Analytics must be made widely
available and used sensitively to reveal the places where health care
can improve. The improvements may be as simple as a reminder phone
call, as sophisticated as the identification of hot-spot
neighborhoods, or as dazzling as the discovery of new miracle
drugs. Technology and social change will meld to create medical
progress, regardless
of <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/02/04/veteran-vc-says-beware-of-health-it-bubble-not-enough-actual-business-plans/">any
hype or overinvestment that may be taking place in the early 2010
decade</a>.

</p>

<p>

People in high-tech like to lecture the health care field to adopt
more of a "Silican Valley mentality"
(<a href="http://recode.net/2014/02/26/what-health-care-can-learn-from-amazon/">this
example</a> is typical, although Amazon.com is not physically located
in the Silicon Valley). While the meaning of that phrase is vague, it
usually brings to mind young hackers making prototypes and rolling out
rapid updates, funded by open-handed venture capitalists (at least
until financial bubbles burst). But in my view, these activities are
not the most important aspects of success in the Silicon
Valley. Furthermore, the modus operandi is not appropriate for
health. In health, the consequences of bug are not just a message
informing a visitor she cannot post a photo. It could mean that a
patient is missing urgent treatment, or being given too much
radiation.

</p>

<p>

The true energy behind the "Silican Valley mentality" lies in the
inquisitive people meeting nightly in basements, kitchens, and hacker
spaces all over the region to show what they've been doing lately,
discuss problems, and come up together with solutions. This mentality
is not taking hold in health IT. User groups meet for various
products, but everyone overall--hospitals, researchers, EHR
consultants--is trying to preserve secrets and use other people's
ignorance to their competitive advantage. Only in hackathons can one
find an open attitude toward making progress. Until health IT experts
form communities to discuss what's bothering them and seek common
ground, there will be little of the Silicon Valley mentality in health
care--and little reform either.

</p>

<p>

In a health care field dominated by chronic illness, health lies in
the hands of each of us. But we can't get better unless we work
together. Sensors, data, personal health records, data sharing, and
open source software are all part of that collaboration.
