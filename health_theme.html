A constellation of new health-related activities and technologies,
supported by research and rolling out slowly into medical practice,
holds the promise of better health for everyone. Underlying these
activities are the collection, analysis, and sharing of data. Driving
the interest in these activities are such pressing needs in the health
care system as:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Controlling chronic illnesses such as diabetes and hypertension to
prevent progression and complications

</li>

<li>

Finding more effective and less intrusive treatments for a range of
diseases, and doing so faster

</li>

<li>

Lowering system-wide costs, or at least reducing the rate of increase

</li>

<li>

Reducing medical errors

</li>

<li>

Improving patients' sense of control over their care and their destiny

</li>

<li>

Easing stress on practitioners and caregivers

</li>

<li>

Sweeping away some of the administrative and bureaucratic load

</li>

</ul>

<p>

What new technologies show the most promise? Why do some seem to
languish despite their apparent advantages? How do all these things
depend on each other, and what technologies and activities need to be
adopted in tandem?

</p>
<p>

The large trends in these ground-breaking approaches--as well as the
things that stand in their way--form the subjects of this paper. This
is not a catalog of applications or technologies, but a high-level
investigation into their potential. The paper's themes will come home
to lots of readers:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Anyone with a career in medicine and the enormous health care
industries will see big changes in the field. These industries aren't
likely to shrink dramatically or be disintermediated as have travel
agents, bookstores, many newspapers, or much of the music recording
industry, but some of their functions will disappear while others leap
into the twenty-first century.

</li>

<li>

Computer experts, data scientists, and other hi-tech professionals
will <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/big-growth-forecast-health-it-market">stream
into health care</a>, where they will stumble upon very unusual norms
and activities.

</li>

<li>

Professionals in public health and health care policy will want to
understand the potential for technology to help affect treatments and
costs, along with the often underestimated probems in applying the
technologies.

</li>

<li>

People concerned about the economic future of nearly any country in the
world should worry about the exploding costs of health care. These are
being driven by aging populations as well as new diagnostic techniques
and treatments that provide astonishing advances in extending human
life, but at great expense, and are exacerbated by inefficient
business and clinical processes, lack of information liquidity, and
overlapping, sometimes contradictory regulatory demands. Smart health
technologies, including patient engagement, could help those increases
to level off.

</li>

<li>

Everybody will feel the shift. Your interactions with this new health
care system--and for the first time, we might really be able to ennoble
our grab-bag of medical practices and technologies by calling them a
"system"--will differ depending on whether you are young or old, live
in a city or the country, are (currently) healthy or chronically
ill--but the interaction will be very different from what most people
have now.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

What are some of the technical changes coming over the horizon?

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Sensors are checking how some elderly residents move around their
homes, registering signs of inactivity that may indicate ill health or
atypical patterns suggesting disorientation.

</li>

<li>

Behavioral conditions are being treated by games, some of which
produce lasting improvements, such as promoting adaptation in victims
PTSD, and control training for people with ADHD by presenting tasks
and then throwing distractions at the player.

</li>

<li>

Large-scale data analysis of patient reactions to marketed drugs turn
up adverse effects not found during clinical trials, and prompt
reconsideration of the sterling trust placed in conventional trials.

</li>

<li>

Electronic record exchange allows patients to walk into a hospital
hundreds of miles from where they have previously been treated and
offer unfamiliar doctors complete medical histories, including key
information such as drug allergies.

</li>

<li>

Mobile phones allow people in isolated rural areas, even in developing
nations, to snap photos of medical problems or even measure vital
signs and get advice from remote doctors.

</li>

<li>

Researchers are starting to release not only articles about their
research, but also the underlying data used to reach their
conclusions, allowing other researchers to check their work, duplicate
studies, and combine the data from multiple experiments.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Technology is always just a tool, and one whose use rises, falls, and
is changed by the people and organizations who use it. Technology also
introduces risks whose effects in medicine can weaken the
doctor/patient relationship and cause life-threatening errors.
Although this article does not delve into social policy or
organizational change, I'll look at some of the impacts these have on
the technologies, and vice versa.

</p>

<p>

Health reformer Arien Malec delineated (in
a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEOF1hKp21c">video-taped
presentation</a>) the tension between technology and the personal
touch. In earlier ages of medicine we enjoyed a personal relationship
with a doctor who knew everything about us and our families--but he
couldn't actually do much for us for lack of effective treatments.
Beginning with the breakthroughs in manufacturing antibiotics and the
mass vaccination programs of the middle 20th Century, medicine has
become increasingly effective but increasingly impersonal. Now we
have medicines and machinery that would awe earlier generations, but
we rarely develop the relationships that can help us overcome chronic
conditions. Health IT can restore the balance, allowing us to make
better use of treatments while creating beneficial relationships.

</p>

<p>

The technologies offer glowing possibilities, but suffer from complex
problems that bedevil their application beyond proofs of
concept. We'll now focus in on various specific technologies, tools
and trends:
</p>

<ul>

<li>

<em><a href="#device_sensor">Devices, sensors, and patient
monitoring</a></em> deals with tangible things we touch, hold, and
wear and how our concern for fitness in daily life can become part of
formal health treatment.

</li>

<li>

<em><a href="#using_data">Using data: records, open data, and open
research</a></em> looks at an area of care that is more hidden away
but will prove absolutely crucial: understanding ourselves through our
data.

</li>

<li>

looks at the changes taking place in treatment settings and where the
technologies we've discussed fit in.

</ul>

<h2>Devices, sensors, and patient monitoring</h2>
</a>

<p>

For many people, the medical devices that usually come to mind are
enormous, clanking machines (radiology, MRI, CT, lab analysis
hardware) that might cost a million dollars or more. Their output
tends to run through labs, radiologists, or other oracles and take
several days for results. But as in other technologies,
miniaturization is transforming medical equipment. Lots of small
devices are already in use, with pacemakers and other cardio implants
having the most dramatic results on quality of life. Other devices
bring health data into the hands of ordinary people.

</p>

<a name="qs_selves">
<h3>From the Quantified Self to Our Selves</h3>
</a>

<p>

Attendees at the
high-profile <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/consumer-electronics-show-will-highlight-new-ways-to-collect-biometric-data/2014/01/05/e8eac584-74c4-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html">Consumer
Electronics Show</a> at the beginning of 2014 lost themselves in a sea
of personal monitoring devices. Whether or not these particular early
consumer devices take off, the field is on the verge of becoming
mainstream,
<a href="http://www.fiercemobileit.com/story/research-mobile-health-app-market-quadruple-2016/2011-11-30">with
the use of apps to expand rapidly</a>, bypassing much of the barriers
to development, regulatory approval, and marketing that currently kepp
devices expensive and focused on a single task.

</p>
<p>

Trends include:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Fitbits and other wearable measurement devices are <a
href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/wearable-fitness-devices-see-historic-surge-popularity">surging
in popularity</a>. Many of these measure not only activity, but
health-related vital signs such as pulse, blood pressure, and oxygen
consumption.

</li>

<li>

Devices are becoming easier and friendlier to use. For instance,
the <a href="http://theheartcheck.com/products/pen_device.html">HeartCheck
Pen</a> is a small, pen-sized device that takes readings from the
thumbs when pressed onto the sensor pads--a device of potential value
to people at risk for stroke and heart attacks.
The <a href="http://bionym.com/">Nymi</a> is a bracelet that measures
one's ECG from the wrist and fingertip. Diabetes patients need to
measure glucose levels frequently and manage insulin dosing to prevent
hyperglycemic complications and avoid hypoglycemic episodes,
so <a href="http://www.medgadget.com/2013/10/non-invasive-measurement-of-blood-glucose-levels-using-glucotrack-interview.html">non-invasive
measurement devices</a> now avoid the need for frequent skin pricks.
Although currently positioned only as an authentication technology (a
security device to replace passwords), the possible medical
applications of a mobile device that measures ECG for things such as
cardiac disease monitoring are exciting.

</li>

<li>

Wristbands and finger clips may soon come to seem quaintly awkward,
with <a href="http://spie.org/x105127.xml">even greater compression on
the way</a>. Reductions in size democratize medicine in many ways: by
lowering the costs of devices, by making them more attractive and
comfortable (a critical consideration for widespread adoption), and by
reducing power requirements. For example, sensors warning of
concussions can
be <a href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/remote-sensors-making-play-concussion-fray">worn
under sports helmets</a> or embedded directly in them,
although <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/15/health/youth-head-sensors/">their
accuracy is disputed</a>.

</li>

<li>

Sensors embedded in pill containers
can <a href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/study-shows-promise-electronic-pill-bottle">notify
doctors when the patients have taken their medication</a>. This can
help clinicians remind patients
and <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2013-03/acoc-prv030613.php">encourage
medication adherence</a>, which is a major problem in maintaining
health because so many patients forget their pills or need urging to
adhere to their regimens. If smart packaging sounds like science
fiction, just
consider <a href="http://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-08-fda-electronic-chips-medications.html">ingestible
pills</a> that work together with a body patch and a smart phone to
signal when they're digested.

</li>

<li>

Robots are
being <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/mobile/10-medical-robots-that-could-change-healthcare/d/d-id/1107696">increasingly
deployed in hospitals</a>, and will eventually turn up in the home and
nursing care facilities as well.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

People use personal devices to measure improvements and push
themselves to do even more (although as we will see, most of the
devices and apps are not used for very long). They also connect with
others engaged in fitness programs and form communities for support.

</p>

<p>

Although some people can benefit individually from reading and
interpreting the displays on their devices, the data is most valuable
when inserted into a patient record and combined with data from other
users. In a patient record, the data can
be <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2013/09/ginger-io-putting-the-patient-provider-connection-at-the-center.html">checked
by clinical experts and be mined for trends</a>. Combining data from
many users enables such benefits such as finding out where they stand.
Are you better or worse off than the norm? Are your vital signs in a
danger zone?

</p>

<a name="individual_home">
<h3>The role of the individual</h3>
</a>

<p>

So the emerging trend in managing chronic conditions, the difficulties
of aging, recovery from traumatic events and surgery--really, anything
that benefits from close attention by clinicians--is to do it in the
environments where the patients spends their time. The Institute for
the Future writes, "Health care is moving from an acute, episodic care
model to a more continuous, chronic care model." (Page 11
of <a href="http://www.iftf.org/uploads/media/SR-1194%20Booting%20Up%20Mobile%20Health.pdf">this
PDF</a>). This paper also lays out the move from the professional
setting to the patient's environment, and the crucial role that mobile
devices and sensors in the hands of patients will play.

</p>
<p>

Dueling trends are at work as devices bring the clinic into the
home. On the one hand, consumer devices are leading toward
the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-03/fitness-apps-eclipse-3-d-tvs-as-digital-health-reaches-ces-tech.html">
vision expressed by health IT leader Samir Damani: "We are really
moving from a doctor-centric society to a patient-centric
society."</a> On the other hand, sensors can be scary and
intrusive. Obviously, consumers will rebel against monitoring unless
their privacy is respected and they feel like partners improving their
own health with the support of the clinician and technology.

</p>

<p>

And the home is not the only place that can join the clinic and the
hospital as places where health coordination takes place--other
important places in people's lives, such
as <a href="http://www.healthit.gov/buzz-blog/beacon-community-program/beacon-support-childrens-health-lessons-learned/">schools</a>
and workplaces, can as well.

</p>

<a name="barrier_device">
<h3>Barriers to devices and sensors</h3>
</a>

<p>

In addition to personal or cultural aversion, the barriers that hold
back adoption of sensor technologies include:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

Cost

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

If we can save lives and avoid emergency room visits or other costly
treatments, a medical device comes cheap at almost any price.
FDA-approved cardiac devices and other implants have established
themselves as cost-effective. But no one can guarantee that the
emerging generation of consumer and patient devices is effective. In
the meantime, most people still think twice before investing in
expensive gadgets of unclear value.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Efficacy

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

It takes a long time and a lot of money develop a medical treatment
and then establish that it's safe and works better than a
placebo. Despite FDA restrictions, small devices present fewer
headaches than drugs because they are unlikely to pose any
non-obvious safety problems. Clinical trials for devices are much
simpler than drug trials for a host of reasons, ranging from the high
failure rate of new chemical entities to the more straightforward
safety considerations of external devices.

</p>

<p>

Still, to line up people with the right combination of medical
conditions, ensure they follow instructions, and measure effects
(especially over a long time period) is a big job. We'll look at the
challenges of clinical trials <a href="#clinical_research">later in
this article</a>. Given so many competing, poorly tested apps, most
fail to be appealing or particularly effective,
so <a href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/report-paints-grim-diabetes-app-use-mHealth-mobile">few
are downloaded by a lot of people</a> (for instance, only 1.2% of the
smart-phone enabled diabetes population uses apps), and far fewer are
used over a long period of time. This resistance means poor market
penetration, difficulty gathering statistically significant measures
of efficacy, and little investor incentive to improve products.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Data quality

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Different devices can report different measurements, raising questions
about how much one can trust them. Each one may produce information
that's useful in a relative sense (i.e, how much it does up and down
over time) but perhaps not useful absolute values.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Simplicity

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Consumers who will spend days setting up a home entertainment center
seem to lose patience when it comes to devices that improve their
health. If the interface is more than a single button, many will give
up at the start. Simplicity must also be the rule in displays. It's
particularly important for the elderly (who did not grow up with
ubiquitous computer technology) and for anyone injured or impaired
(chemotherapy and dementia are just two burdens that affect one's
ability to remember and follow technical instructions).

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Overmeasurement

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

People can get compulsive when measuring themselves, and overinterpret
changes from day to day or hour to hour. Measuring your blood pressure
can raise your blood pressure! In general, throwing data into a bucket
doesn't improve our knowledge; we should determine our goals first and
then collect the data that we can process to help reach the goals.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Interoperability

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

When an environment contains multiple sensors and devices, whether in
the home or in the hospital, good care requires them to work
together. Some standards exist to help devices communicate, such as
the Data Distribution Service (DDS), MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT),
and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP). In an age where
coordinated systems keep airplanes on course, it's ridiculous that
most medical devices are not designed to work with other devices.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Integration with records

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Before data can enter patient records, systems must be designed to
gather well-structured patient data, and appropriate privacy and
security controls must be in place. Few electronic health systems
currently accept data directly from patients, who still fill out paper
forms to be entered by clerks into electronic formats. Furthermore,
some patients will be tempted to falsify data under some circumstances
(such as when employee reward programs for health improvement are in
place), so there must be technical measures to prevent tampering with
device output. Clinicians
are <a href="http://www.hl7standards.com/blog/2014/01/09/pghd/">predisposed
to mistrust patient-generated data</a>, even though most of the
information in clinical interviews comes from patients.

</p>

</dd>

</dl>

<p>

Although most manufacturers of the current generation of consumer
devices are careful to label them for "fitness" rather than "health,"
there is a point where the use of some devices trespasses into the
realm regulated by government. The FDA has even declared that it has
jurisdiction
over <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-to-regulate-some-medical-related-apps/">mobile
phone apps that have clear medical purposes</a>, although the agency
is doing its best to keep its hands off popular devices and apps for
casual use.

</p>

<p>

An Endeavour
Partners <a href="http://endeavourpartners.net/assets/Endeavour-Partners-Wearables-White-Paper-20141.pdf">white
paper</a> found that one-third of people who buy wearable devices give
them up within six months, and half within two years (Page 4). Perhaps
the users felt that the devices met their goals in that period, such
as weight loss or establish a regular exercise routine. But the white
paper urges long-term use, and proposes nine criteria that could bond
users to their fitness devices. In addition to psychological factors
such as attractiveness, ease of use, and reinforcement for the user's
goals, the white paper urges the provision of an API so that data can
be integrated, and tapping into social networks for support.

</p>

<a name="using_data">
<h2>Using data: records, open data, and open research</h2>
</a>

<p>

Just as we don't think often about the electrons coursing through most
of the tools we use in twenty-first century life (until the number of
bars on our screen reaches an alarming low), we don't often notice the
data that connects us. For the devices covered in the previous
sections, data is paramount because it's what we want from them in the
first place. Data injects power throughout the rest of the health care
system as well. This section will look first at how data is gathered,
stored, and analyzed, then at the use of open data sets and the role
of shared data in clinical research. All of these initiatives
potentially improve health through shared data and its analysis.

</p>

<a name="ehr">
<h3>Electronic health systems</h3>
</a>

<p>

Walking into clinics where the staff carry around paper records makes
you feel like you caught an old 1930s movie and should be seeing the
scene in black and white. Recently, superficial signs of progress have
taken hold: the health field in the United States boasts about the
increasing adoption of electronic records--particularly
<a href="http://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/onc-data-brief-7-december-2012.pdf">since
the roll-out of Meaningful Use incentives in 2009</a>. But don't jump
to conclusions about the capabilities of new electronic systems: many
are harder to use than the paper records they replace, and barely more
useful.

</p>

<p>

In the United States, virtually every doctor uses electronic records
and exchange for billing, because money is the lifeblood of both the
health practices and the payers. But other activities, even something
as basic as ordering a prescription from a pharmacy is done manually.

</p>

<p>

When clinical patient records do get digitized, they remain what one
doctor called an "electronic file cabinet," separate from all the work
of planning and executing care. This article will refer to such
documents as an electronic health record (or EHR), because that term
is so common, but we must really think of patient records as a
critical component of an entire health system that involves a sequence
of events with each patient, along with analytics that set the
direction of whole collections of clinics and hospitals. And one
question running through this article is how the EHR can be used more
effectively throughout the operation of health institutions in what
reformers like to call
a <a href="http://iom.edu/Reports/2012/Best-Care-at-Lower-Cost-The-Path-to-Continuously-Learning-Health-Care-in-America.aspx"><em>learning
health care system</em></a>.

</p>

<p>

In other day-to-day activities, we're used to making orders online and
preserving data electronically. The same kinds of benefits come from
electronic records: easier appointments, expedited drug orders and
refills, faster billing and reimbursement, etc.

</p>

<p>

Looking beyond convenience is the promise of clinical decision support
(CDS). Doctors can't independently keep in their prefrontal cortexes
all the information they need to suggest accurate diagnoses and
treatments--even the doctors (grudgingly) admit that, which is why
specialists and consultations exist. How can electronic records
augment clinicians' intelligence?

</p>

<ul>

<li>

At the most basic level, record systems emit alerts to warn doctors of
actions they propose that are inconsistent with the data in the
records, such as when a patient has an allergy to a medication or the
dose seems wrong. Other alerts are thrown at nursing staff constantly
from cardiac monitors, intravenous delivery devices, and other
equipment attached to patients.

</li>

<li>

Electronic records can also prompt diagnostic and reimbursement code
as well as suggesting appropriate drugs in response to data
entered. Unfortunately, electronic systems have not proven able to do
this reliably. The Insurance Institute for HIT Safety
writes, <a href="http://www.iihits.com/clinical-decision-support.html">"CDS
appears to pose a slew of medical legal risks...while offering few--if
any--protections."</a>

</li>

<li>

The cutting edge of computer support can be seen in experimental
software that generates diagnoses when fed patient histories. Such
"expert systems" were tried in medicine as far back as the 1980s, but
fizzled out in the face of limitations in hardware power, speed, and memory as well as lack of flexible database technology.
Still, with the enormous
speed-up in computing and the rebirth of artificial intelligence in
the twenty-first century, researchers
are <a href="http://fdlaction.firedoglake.com/2013/02/12/the-computer-that-could-replace-your-doctor/">trying
again</a> to see whether the doctor can be rendered superfluous. IBM's
Watson, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/ibm-forms-watson-business-group-will-commercialization-follow-7000024929/">which
they started to commercialize in January 2014</a>, famously proved
that natural language analysis can bring to the surface multiple
plausible diagnoses for doctors to choose from. But we should
take <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/01/10/doctors-or-algorithms/">predictions
about the obsolescence of the doctor</a> with a grain of salt.

</li>

<li>

A digital health system can help the staff intervene with patients,
through such simple measures as reminding them to schedule and come to
follow-up visits. These sorts of interventions can reduce the risk of
hospitalization among high-risk patients, such
<a href="http://www.fiercehealthit.com/story/tech-helps-control-diabetes-western-new-york-beacon-community/2013-12-12">those
suffering from diabetes</a>. This is a clear example of technology
that supports, instead of interfering with, the relationship between
clinician and patient.

</li>
<li>

A well-structured record-based system can flag patients at high risk,
telling staff where to concentrate their attention.

</li>

<li>

A patient web portal can allow clients to make appointments, check
results of tests, check for errors in diagnoses or medication lists,
and communicate with the staff for non-urgent questions. This is the
simplest and most obvious application of digital technology in an age
when most people can schedule car repairs and hotel reservations
online, but it's surprising how few clinicians allow such basic online
interaction.

</li>

<li>

Analysis of large data sets can turn up problems that help agencies
improve public health. They can also reduce costs by helping hospitals
identify and prioritize high-risk patients (a process called patient
stratification). They also allow payers to define
<a href="http://www.ncsl.org/portals/1/documents/health/EPISODE_of_CARE-2010.pdf">"episodes
of care"</a> that supposedly encompass all the treatment a patient
needed for a particular problem. This in turn lets payers define how
much the health providers should be reimbursed for treating various
patients with the same condition.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Some large institutions--notably the Department of Veterans Affairs,
with its famous VistA software, and Kaiser Permanente--have
historically created relatively well-integrated health systems that
support sophisticated interventions to improve patient health. This
requires a long-term process, integrating multiple hospital systems
around the records and training all their clinicians to take advantage
of the data they track. The institutions that do this have taken on a
comprehensive role in the patient's lives, being responsible for
insuring them as well as treating them. They represent the kind of
all-encompassing, cradle-to-grave coverage that many developed
countries do at a national level, and that we will look
at <a href="#aco_integrated">under the topic of accountable care
organizations</a>. According to one account, Kaiser
Permanente's <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/d/the-industry-standard/how-kaiser-bet-4-billion-electronic-health-records-and-won-217731">four
billion dollar expenditure on electronic health records</a> paid off.

</p>

<p>

Most deployments of electronic health records achieve considerably
less than the best sites do, however. Most EHR systems follow an old
1980s model of software development:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

They are entirely proprietary, although standards (which we'll look at
shortly) have been superimposed and are beginning to allow limited
data sharing. Significant barriers to entry (through regulatory
capture and installed bases) have allowed early entrants in the vendor
space to lock in large market shares with legacy technologies that are
hard for innovators to supplant.

</li>

<li>

Most systems predate the Web or use old technologies such as MUMPS
(standardized as the M language) that don't mesh well with the
Web. This leads to kludgy and limited work-arounds just so that EHRs
can meet such basic expectations as patient portals and, access by
clinicians on mobile devices. More recent entrants in the EHR space,
such as <a href="http://www.athenahealth.com/">Athenahealth</a>
and <a href="http://www.practicefusion.com">Practice Fusion</a>, have
chosen to go all-online (Software as a Service, or SaaS), providing
web-based records. They tend to be popular among physicians, but less
so among IT departments and administrators. And providing software a
service makes it hard to adapt systems to individual settings.

</li>

<li>

Not being standards-based, existing software is expensive to develop,
install, and maintain. EHRs' market has therefore been large
institutions with millions of dollars to spend on licenses and
millions more on implementation. Until recently, they have totally
bypassed the small community and rural providers where digital records
could tremendously improve care.

</li>

<li>

Many existing record systems have been developed to meet the interests
of the hospital and clinic administrators who make out purchase orders
and deal with third-party payers, not the interests of clinicians who
ultimately have to use the system for patient care. Such EHRs' chief
purpose is financial rather than clinical. Some of the "clinical
decision support" built-in to these systems actually tells doctors how
to find the codes that legally maximize the payment for a given course
of treatment (a trick called "up-coding").

</li>

<li>

Although digitization has transformed other industries, such as
e-commerce and finance, by facilitating data exchange, the long
proprietary history of EHRs leaves them stubbornly resistant to
interoperability. The standards in this area have improved recently,
as we'll see later in the article. But currently, it is hard even for
patients to obtain their own records, on paper or electronically--a
right enshrined in law through HIPAA.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Given the high prices associated with electronic records, they were
adopted only by large organizations up until the passage of
the <a href="http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/hitech-act">HITECH
act</a>, part of the 2008 economic recovery act. The incentives in
HITECH <a href="http://dashboard.healthit.gov/HITAdoption/">spurred
adoption</a>. But improvements in quality through electronic records
are more elusive. Although most studies show improvements in care,
they turn out to be small and scattered.

</p>
<p>

For instance, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)
found
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK37988/">and some
decrease in unnecessary tests, and improvements in pediatric care,
particularly around prescriptions</a>. But many other areas showed no
improvement, or a statistically insignificant one.
A <a href="http://jamia.bmj.com/content/19/3/360.full">2011
article</a> in the Journal of the American Medical Informatics
Association found benefits in medication prescription.

</p>

<p>

EHR systems, unfortunately, can be habit-forming whether or not they
provide the expected benefits. Institutions that adopt the systems
soon find themselves locked in because their data exists in a cryptic
format understood only by the vendor and cannot be rescued in order to
move to a different system. When the systems are ill-suited to modern
habits (such as mobile access) or to new needs such as data sharing,
institutions find a transition prohibitively expensive and
disruptive. So there's a big risk that EHRs promising Meaningful Use
will fail to meet the new requirements during the day-to-day knocking
about they receive (even if they are certified as Meaningful Use
compliant), and that the thousands of new health practices adopting
the EHRs will join their fellow prisoners among earlier adopters.

</p>

<p>

Errors can also be introduced by electronic records, as many
of <a href="http://cci.drexel.edu/faculty/ssilverstein/cases/">stories
attest</a>. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a major
<a href="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2011/Health-IT-and-Patient-Safety-Building-Safer-Systems-for-Better-Care.aspx">report
warning about safety problems in November 2011, the AHRQ prepared
a <a href="http://healthit.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/citation/HealthITHazardManagerFinalReport.pdf">report
on tracking and assessing risks in electronic health systems</a> in
May 2012 (a summary of risks appears on page 29), and the Office of
the National Coordinator (which is responsible for administering the
government's electronic health record program) released
<a href="http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/safer">extensive
safety guidelines in January 2014</a>. Besides plain and simple
bugs--for which the vendor denies liability--problems include:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Confusing interfaces that make it seem some information was recorded
when it was not, or the reverse.

</li>

<li>

Arbitrary restrictions, such as drop-down menus that leave out the
medications or other choices that the clinician wants to choose.

</li>

<li>

Records that allow similar information in two or more places, thus
creating such risks as duplicate dosages. This can certainly happen
with paper records too, but electronic records hide the duplication
better and staff are less likely to know that duplicate locations
exist.

</li>

<li>

Information that is hard to see, perhaps simply because it is outside
the visible part of the page and the clinician forgets to scroll the
screen.

</li>

<li>

Overuse of alerts. Some systems blindly report every possible side
effect to using a medication, leading to "alert fatigue" among
clinicians, who ultimately can miss an alert that they really should
have heeded. Hospital wards are as noisy as tropical forests with the
sound of beeps instead of animal calls. The constant din of multiple
competing alerts creates a poor signal-to-noise ratio.

</li>

<li>

Images that are distorted or have text overlaid in the wrong places.

</li>

<li>

Unauthorized sharing of patient data.

</li>

</ul>


<p>

Like industrial accidents and airplane crashes, medical errors
generally emerge from complex interactions of many factors such as
haste, misreported symptoms, and plain bad luck, where one factor may
be an EHR that gets in the way, hides information behind multiple
clicks, or has a garbled display.

</p>

<p>

Errors in electronic records also tend to propagate. In such cases,
one of the traits that makes them most valuable--data sharing--turns
into a vulnerability. And a data breach with EHRs can put millions of
patients at risk in one fell swoop, as front-page news reports also
remind us regularly. Many doctors would like the FDA to regulate
electronic records in hospitals as it regulates other medical devices,
claiming that increased costs are worth the problems that would be
averted.

</p>

<p>

The reporting requirements that the government and insurers add,
potentially a boon for patient care and public health, create more
work that is often redundant. For instance, stage 1 of Meaningful Use
requires the doctor to report whether she checked the hemoglobin A1c
of each diabetic patient. In theory, electronic systems should take on
much of the clerical burden of such reporting requirements. For
instance, the information that the patient has diabetes and that the
lab ran a hemoglobin test is in the record, but current EHR systems do
not automatically report it, requiring the doctor instead to do
so manually. Such EHR systems should not be certified as Meaningful Use
compliant, but neither the certification authorities nor the EHR
vendors care whether the doctor's work in negatively impacted. No
wonder <a
href="http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2014/01/23/Doctors-spend-third-of-time-with-patients-looking-at-computer/UPI-79101390532163/">doctors
</a> spend a third of their time with patients looking at
computer</a>, imperiling their relationships with the patients (as we
will see later, the core of medicine is the relationship).

</p>

<p>

Pathways toward improving electronic records include:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

Better attention to safety

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Electronic record systems definitely improve safety in some ways--such
as eliminating confusion in handwritten notes, and displaying warnings
about adverse drug reactions--but can introduce other sources of
error, such as choosing the drug that appears on a pull-down menu next
to the one that was meant to be selected.

</p>

<p>

EHR vendors contractually deny responsibility for errors entered into
records through bugs or confusing interfaces. The health provider, who
is presumably able to check for and catch any errors, bears liability
for anything that goes wrong with a patient. To be fair, throughout
the computer industry, software manufacturers commonly assert no
warranty for software bugs.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Intense clinician involvement in design

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

The people using the interface must be part of the design team
throughout the project, not just brought in as external consultants
intermittently. Iterative development and rapid prototyping can help
users who don't understand IT collaborate with IT professionals who
don't understand medicine to create effective tools. Some people say
that the relative success of VistA sprang from its genesis among
doctors and nurses at the Department of Veterans Affairs, who did much
of their own coding. All institutions that are happy with their
electronic systems have declared that the most crucial factor in their
success was bringing in the staff and making them feel ownership of
the transition. In fact, making a transition is so time-consuming that
it probably exceeds the costs of the software. Finally, user
interfaces must be easier to change.

</p>
<p>

Electronic health records have some of the most notoriously
user-unfriendly software interfaces. As mentioned earlier, the people
making purchase decisions are in administration. The dissatisfaction
that doctors express about their record systems
is <a href="http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/medical-economics/news/physician-outcry-ehr-functionality-cost-will-shake-health-information-technol">well
known</a>. Some of the difficulties come from clinicians that are not
used to computers (yes, quite a lot of them are in the field), from
the urgency and chaos endemic to many medical environments, or to
resistance of staff to give up poor workflows. But sometimes the
record system imposes its own rigid workflow without just cause. An
AHRQ <a href="http://www.himss.org/files/HIMSSorg/content/files/Code%20119%20-%20EHR%20Usability_Evaluation%20and%20Use%20Case%20Framework_AHRQ.pdf">study
on EHR usability</a> laid out fairly simple requirements for tying
patient information to treatment plans, but stressed the importance of
selecting only the relevant information and presenting it clearly.

</p>

<p>

Too often, neither EHR vendors nor internal IT departments understand
what the physicians need to see and do not respect the value of their
time. For instance, instructions added by a clinician to the software
may be printed out as part of the record, probably by a programmer who
couldn't tell the difference between instructions and patient
information. Such awkward interfaces drain precious time from the
physicians' and nurses' days, reducing the time they can spend with
patients and contributing to the serious shortage of physicians that
threatens the hope for universally accessible health care in the US.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

More agile systems

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Even though every health institution is unique and adapting
electronic records to the enterprise is critical, most record systems
offer very few customizations (for instance, they generally allow
doctors to choose which medications appear on a list of treatments for
a particular condition, and which alerts pop up). Serious changes
require an investment in certified consultants, extra contracted work
with vendors, or extra demands on overworked internal IT organizations
that don't possess the expertise to do the job. Changes that require
vendor action take place on the vendor's schedule. A common complaint
among doctors is that new EHR vendors act responsive and agile with
their first customers, and then turn just as blank and bureaucratic as
all the older vendors when success and growth come.

</p>

<p>

When local sites do make customizations, they my be swept away by the
next software upgrade. When smaller vendors go out of business or are
merged into larger firms, maintenance and tech support may vanish.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

More transparency

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

</p>

Contracts and vendor responsibilities could be much more balanced and
reasonable, as
<a href="http://jamia.bmj.com/site/icons/amiajnl8946.pdf">recommended
by the American Medical Informatics Association</a>. This includes
rights of software users as basic as discussing costs of products and
defects.

</dd>

</ul>

<p>

The designers of the HITECH act were well aware that adoption of a
technology does not guarantee effective exploitation of the
technology's benefits; that's why their reimbursement program was
labeled Meaningful Use in a top-down attempt to improve the way
physicians use records.

</p>

<p>

Some problems of EHR systems are solved at lower cost through free
software. Free software or open source EHR software includes
<a href="http://openmrs.org/">OpenMRS</a>, <a href="http://www.openehr.org/">OpenEHR</a>,
<a href="http://home.tolvenhealth.com/">Tolven</a>, <a href="http://oscarcanada.org/">OSCAR,
and several variants of VistA, whose development is now coordinated by
a foundation called <a href="http://www.osehra.org/">OSEHRA</a>.
VistA
is <a href="http://www.openhealthnews.com/hotnews/vista-rivals-epic-and-cerner-major-deployments-ehr-systems">gaining
a bigger installed base</a>, although its penetration is nowhere near
what its fame would seem to deserve. Deployments of open source health
records in developing nations
are <a href="http://www.pih.org/blog/university-hospitals-open-source-emr-a-model-for-evidence-based-health-care">supported
by Partners in Health</a>, among others.

</p>

<p>

The low adoption rate for these open source alternatives (at least in
the United States) has been blamed on disparate issues ranging from
sheer prejudice in the health care field to poor marketing. Certainly,
many of this open source software has academic or government origins,
and therefore aren't backed by strong sales or support
organizations. VistA's dependency on MUMPS also dissuades enough
potential developers that MUMPS wrappers have been created for other
languages. But it also may simply be that an EHR system that truly
makes life easy for clinicians has yet to be created.

</p>

<p>

One of the foundations of innovation consists of public data sets
about providers, patients, and communities. But these public data sets
join patients as victims of the continual capture of data in
electronic record systems that don't interoperate well. We'll turn
next to the promise of open, public data.

</p>

<a name="open_data">
<h3>Open data</h3>
</a>

<p>

Every year, the US Department of Health and Human Services holds a
large national forum dubbed the Health Datapalooza by Todd Park,
former Department CTO. The forum highlights new data sets released by
HHS and provides opportunities for activists as well as potential
entrepreneurs to talk to HHS and each other about good uses to which
they can put the data. It becomes a platform on which state
authorities can target high-risk areas, web sites can help patients
choose health care providers, and other unanticipated value can arise.

</p>

<p>

HHS was not only one of the first institutions in the United States to
offer open health data, but one of the first US agencies to join the
open data movement, launching
an <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/open">open data gold rush on the
federal level</a>. Other countries offering health data
include <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jan/24/sharing-nhs-medical-records-healthcare">the
United Kingdom</a>
and <a href="http://www2.datasus.gov.br/DATASUS/index.php?area=02">Brazil</a>.

</p>

<p>

Public agencies gather huge amounts of valuable data, but the release
of their data may lag months behind the events they track. This can be
blamed on the great efforts it takes to curate and clean that data,
but also to bureaucracy, budgetary constraints, or persistent workflows
based on pre-Internet ways of sharing data.

</p>

<p>

Sometimes it may be hard to figure out what we can learn from the
particular data being collected and released by governments, payers,
or providers. But
researchers from astronomers to military strategists have often had to
draw on their cleverness to draw the insights they need from the data
they can get. One example in health care is
the <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2013/06/moving-to-the-open-health-care-graph.html">use
of data on referrals to infer the quality of doctors</a>.

</p>

<p>

The practice of releasing large data sets on patients illustrates the
potential of integrated care--along with the risks to patient
privacy. Public data sets may hold the secrets to improved medical
care, but they are problematic from a privacy standpoint because it's
becoming easier and easier to identify patients who are supposed be
anonymous. Researcher Latanya Sweeney, who famously reidentified
Massachusetts Governor William Weld from publicly available data,
pulled off a similar feat in
2013 <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-06-05/states-hospital-data-for-sale-leaves-veteran-s-privacy-at-risk">using
data from the state of Washington state</a>. Data providers are
improving their anonymization techniques, but they are fighting a
constant battle against increasingly sophisticated data mining
algorithms and the increasing availability of data sets on ordinary
people.

</p>

<p>

If anonymization is hard to manage, so are more basic technical
issues. Organizations generally collect data in self-contained
databases. A surprisingly large number still use flat files or
spreadsheets. Although they could upload those spreadsheets and force
users to download and disassemble them, the data sets can instead be
converted to an entirely different, computer-friendly format that
allows simple programmatic access through a RESTful API. Converting
data, as well as creating and maintaining future data in this way
takes a big investment in many and IT expertise. It can't be done just
once, unless the enterprise adopts new technology, policies, and
procedures to generate or incorporate data into the system access by
the API.

</p>

<a name="clinical_research">
<h3>Reframing clinical research</h3>
</a>

<p>

Clinical research is the foundation of modern health--the sanctified
procedure through which new truths are found and verified--but even
this hallowed institution is undergoing wrenching changes. Researchers
have been embarrassed by revelations that few scientific experiments
can be replicated, and many shiboleths erected by clinical research in
health care have been overturned through retrospective, longitudinal
studies. Shared data plays a big role in many of the innovations.

</p>

<p>

Big pharma is in trouble. Household names--Pfizer, Merck, Eli Lilly,
Novartis, Bristol-Myers Squibb--that have depended on a blockbuster
model since the 1980s that lavished billions of dollars on
advertising, wooing doctors, sponsoring conferences, and lobbying
officials are reaching the end of flush times. They have apparently
already invented all the blockbusters--billion-dollar drugs that treat
large numbers of people for common ailments--so they now need to
invest increasing sums to find more elusive compounds serving smaller
populations, and therefore generating smaller profit margins.

</p>

<p>

Compounding their distress is the
<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-11-14/2014-outlook-big-pharma-drugs-going-off-patent">expiration
of patents that allow them to enforce high prices</a> through an
effective monopoly on popular medications, and ever stricter
requirements for clinical
trials, <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2805%2967712-4/fulltext">imposed
by the FDA after disturbing safety lapses such the Vioxx case</a>.
For a number of reasons--some pertaining to FDA funding, but others
springing from the difficulties of developing safe and effective
drugs--<a href="http://www.sci-tech-today.com/story.xhtml?story_id=023001ATK5PN">the
FDA is approving many fewer drugs than in the early 1990s</a>.
Finally, researchers are having so much trouble getting patients in
the US to sign up for clinical trials that a lack of subjects is cited
as the reason behind the
<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/doctors-too-few-cancer-patients-154156014.html">40% of cancer trials that don't run to completion</a>.

</p>

<p>

Despite ongoing research efforts in genomics, biology, high-throughput
screening, data analysis, and biotechnology, there have been no recent
game-changing breakthroughs to unjam pharmaceutical research, so
companies are starting to look with a newly creative eye at clinical
research. Innovations include:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Looking for new incentives and means of outreach to increase the pool
of patients willing to undergo trials.

</li>

<li>

Using big data analytics to improve the targeting of disease and the
design of trials, and using electronic records better to support trial
operations, administration and data collection.

</li>

<li>

Giving patients more of a say in the conduct of trials. Cracks are
appearing in the research ivory tower
through <a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2014/02/crowdsourcing-develop-clinical-trials.html">crowdsourcing
suggestions</a> such as submitting drafts for clinical trials for
public scrutiny, and even letting patients suggest trials.

</li>

<li>

Cooperating around basic research that does not produce a marketable
result such as a drug compound, called "pre-competitive" research.

</li>

<li>

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/larryhusten/2014/01/30/johnson-johnson-will-share-clinical-trial-data/">Releasing
data from clinical trials</a>, notably those trials that produce
negative results most drug companies would rather not make public.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

These all aim at a less top-down, more collaborative development
process. A whole class of games such
as <a href="http://eterna.cmu.edu/web/">Eterna</a> engage the curious
public to solve problems in genetics, while crowdsourcing sites such
as href="http://folding.stanford.edu/">Folding@home</a> just ask for
our space computer cycles,
like <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/">SETI@Home</a>
famously does for astronomy.

</p>

<p>

Collaborative research requires data sharing, which in turn
requires some agreement on formats and categorization of data.
<a href="http://sagebase.org/about-2/">Sage Bionetworks</a> is one of
the organizations promoting
collaboration. A <a href="http://www.openhealthnews.com/resources/health-it-category/genomics-genetic-medicine">wide
range of repositories</a>, such
as <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">the Cancer Genome Atlas</a>,
offer fodder for researchers.

</p>

<p>

Data sharing can be a career-limiting move. Pharma companies risk that
a competitor will build a patentable compound on top of their research
and steal their market. Lab researchers risk having someone else
publish first (rival researchers have been known to win or lose
publication races by a few days). Perhaps the health field needs to
broaden its range of awards, so that a patent or published paper is
not the gold standard for advancing careers.

</p>

<p>

Meanwhile, a lot of people have decided not to wait for clinical
trials, because they cost millions and can't be rolled out for
everything that interests patients. Their results often don't even
apply to many patients, because trial subjects should be "ideal"
patients, healthy except for the condition the drug is meant to
treat. Some patients are engaging in citizen science to host clinical
trials or establish looser frameworks for discovering new
cures. Patients also come together through organizations such
as <a href="http://www.patientslikeme.com/">PatientsLikeMe</a>
and <a href="https://www.23andme.com">23andMe</a> (which has had to
suspend health-related activities after a dispute with the FDA over
claims made for them) to upload personal genomics and disease
information for data mining that
can <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v29/n5/full/nbt.1837.html">turn
up trends long before clinical researchers could establish them
formally</a>. These health sites are turbo-charged and data-driven
upgrades to the forums that patients spontaneously form on social
networks, and represent a digital form of
disease-specific <a href="http://www.geneticalliance.org/">patient
alliances</a>.

</p>

<p>

Controversy exists over the collection of data from patients, even
when it's voluntary, because this data can be used for market
research and other activities patients might not support. Because
money spent to develop mobile apps cannot be recouped through sales,
and because HIPAA does not cover apps (having been passed before
the category existed), many
developers <a href="http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/Stories/2014/January/15/checking-your-blood-pressure-you-can-sell-your-personal-information.aspx">collect
and resell data from users</a>. Patients also harbor quite reasonable
fears, discussed under <a href="#open_data">the section on open
data</a>, that a life insurance company, employer, or identity thief
could deidentify the data and use it against the patient.
<a href="http://patientprivacyrights.org/2005/02/testimony-of-dr-alan-f-westin-professor-of-public-law-government-emeritus-columbia-university-and-director-of-the-program-on-information-technology-health-records-and-privacy/">Widely
cited research by law professor Alan Westin</a> shows that consumers
worry about the safety of their patient data and want a say in where
their data goes.

</p>

<p>

It would be too cumbersome to make researchers return to all their
research subjects to ask permission for every new use of data, but
some method is needed to let patients grant permissions for certain
kinds of research they support. Most patients do want their data used
to improve health outcomes. The debate over patient data parallels
that being conducted about the use of patient tissues and other
physical samples. There are no clear answers, but only trade-offs to
choose among.

</p>

<a name="ehr_barrier">
<h3>Barriers to using data</h3>
</a>

<p>

Barriers to reaping the benefits of data include:

</p>

<dt>

Patient variability

</dt>

<dd>

The intractable individuality of patients was one factor that doomed
early expert systems. Nobody is a pure specimen of any single
condition; everyone has complicating factors that require subtle
weighings of possibilities. so no simple field can capture every
nuance of patient behavior. Diseases and conditions also interact,
sometimes in non-obvious ways: for instance, knee injuries are related
to obesity, while diabetes and urinary tract infections can cause
dementia. Complex histories are hard to record: for instance, a
check-box indicating whether or not a patient smokes can't indicate
whether he smoked for thirty years but successfully gave it
up. Furthermore, computer systems can't take into account that
patients and doctors differ in their abilities to obtain, adhere to,
pay for, deliver, and respond to treatments.

</dd>

<dt>

Unstructured data

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

Due partly to patient variability and partly to a long habitude of
clinicians to use paper notes, an estimated 80% of medical data enters
records as free-form text, along with images that also count as
unstructured data. For most analytics, these records present a brick
wall, although there have been recent advances in natural language
processing for medical records. IBM's Watson was already mentioned; other entrants in the space include <a
href="http://clinithink.com/solutions/">Clinithink</a> and
<a href="http://www.nuance.com/for-healthcare/resources/clinical-language-understanding/index.htm">Nuance</a>.
As an example of the difficulties such software must surmount, one can
easily pick out the words "cocaine use," but miss that the phrase
occurred in the context, "cocaine use proven not to be a factor."

</p>

<p>

Even if doctors enter data into structured fields, the EHR software
may provide several different fields that could plausibly store the
data, so the same information for different patients may be in
different places in the record.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Alert fatigue

</dt>

<dd>

EHRs and hospital devices are programmed to react crudely to triggers,
and manufacturers have set the triggers to be sensitive from fear of
missing something important. The result is that a doctor cannot get
through a write-up of a routine visit without clicking on innumerable
dialog boxes to make them go away. Although EHRs theoretically allow
doctors to customize the alerts that appear, no one has yet created a
truly intelligent alert system with acceptable levels both of false
negatives (which should be zero) and false positives (which are much
too high now).

</dd>

<dt>

Cost

</dt>

<dd>

Good equipment for telehealth can be expensive. Bandwidth for video
hook-ups, for instance, is not universally available. And although an
image may be sent to a clinician's cell phone, the phone's screen
probably lacks sufficient resolution to show the necessary detail.

</dd>

</dl>

<p>

A feasible solution to the patient record problem would involve:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

Free software

</dt>

<dd>

A powerful open source EHR platform, widely adopted, would permit rapid
innovation as new medical discoveries reveal the need for new data
fields and interactions. Many projects larger than an EHR have been
developed using free software methods, including Linux. It is
noteworthy that
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/09/google-and-samsung-soar-into-list-of-top-10-linux-contributors/">most
Linux development is now contributed by large corporations</a>--Intel,
IBM, Red Hat, Google, Samsung, and even Microsoft--who understand that
investments in a robust, free software code base are paid back
many-fold in the form of other business opportunities. Hospitals and
governments have even greater incentives to support open source in
health. Proprietary vendors, to reduce their own development costs,
are getting more motivated to integrate with open-source solutions
(e.g., via middleware).

Application programming interfaces (APIs)

<dd>

Modern computing treats data sources as platforms on which other
people can build applications. Cloud storage, with a standard
interface into the data, allows innovators to flock to the underlying
platform and enrich it through add-on software. RESTful APIs have been
popular for years, and are supported by powerful libraries in nearly
every programming language. Promising initiatives come from the giant
health plan
<a href="http://share.kaiserpermanente.org/article/interchangesm-by-kaiser-permanente-unleashes-the-power-of-digital-health-through-open-api/">Kaiser
Permanente</a>, from the
payer/provider <a href="https://developer.carepass.com/">Aetna</a>,
and from
the online record system
<a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/04/11/athenahealth-and-mashery-team-up-for-health-developer-friendly-api-initiative/">athenahealth<a/>. All
of these institutions have offered platforms for third-party
developers to offer applications.

</dd>

<dt>

Analytics

</dt>

<dd>

The data in electronic records needs to be useful if we expect it to
be used. It value comes largely from analytics that can extract trends
fro information about patients and the institutions treating
them. Currently, "big data" (a convenient catch-all phrase for the
enhanced statistical techniques now being used to explore correlations
among large and often relatively unstructured data sets) is entering
health care through numerous small companies wielding mind-numbing
analytical expertise. But until basic analyses become cheap and
universal, records in most institutions will still have their secrets
locked inside. Furthermore, health providers will have to realize
that, in an environment of declining payments and demands that
providers show value for what they do, they urgently need these
analytics.

</dd>

<dt>

Patient control

</dt>

<dd>

No one benefits as much as patients from the convenience and
predictive power of electronic records. As we'll see, patient control
is not only feasible but a key to aiding research.

</dd>

</dl>

<p>

Standards for entering diseases and patient conditions also complicate
clinical data entry, although the electronic systems are not to
blame. Both <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_main.html">SNOMED</a>
and
the <a href="http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/bluebook.pdf">ICD
series</a> are used to represent disease, but most billing in the
United States requires ICD. Although the latest version, ICD-10, was
finalized in 1990, and work on its successor ICD-11 is well underway,
US health organizations are still using the older ICD-9.

</p>

<p>

Based on assessments
that <a href="http://library.ahima.org/xpedio/groups/public/documents/ahima/bok1_036866.hcsp?dDocName=bok1_036866">ICD-10
will improve individual patient care, public health, and medical
research</a>, the government is now requiring a move to ICD-10 that is
<a href="http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/issues/22_2/Countdown-to-ICD-10-47180-1.html">straining
health organizations to a worrisome degree</a>. ICD-9 was already
fairly hard to traverse, at 18,000 codes, but ICD-10 increases this
number to 87,000 (see the Background section on
<a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/solutions-managing-your-practice/coding-billing-insurance/hipaahealth-insurance-portability-accountability-act/transaction-code-set-standards/icd10-code-set.page">this
page</a>). And ICD-10, developed as a reimbursement and billing tool,
is hardly a perfect map of medical knowledge, especially with
accelerating change from genomics, metabolomics, and systems biology.

</p>

<p>

The American Medical Association seems to
see the requirement to use ICD-10 as a
<a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/washington/icd-10-letter-to-cms-12feb2014.pdf">distraction
that will detract from the investments that physicians need to make
to improve patient care</a>.

</p>

<p>

As mentioned earlier, patients are infinitely variable. Not only are
there many distinct medical conditions, but one condition will affect
another. The designers of the ICD standards understood this and made a
stab at representing relationships by extending the set. For instance,
ICD-10 code Ill covers "Hypertensive heart and kidney disease" as well
as "Hypertensive heart disease, w CHF." The standard also tries to
represent adverse effects of treatments through its T80 codes. But
this is a game that could go on forever. A essentially flat, minimally
hierarchical list of individual codes can't possibly represent the
complexity of interactions between medical conditions.

</p>

<p>

A superior way to approach intersecting diseases may be for a standard
to represent diagnoses for individual diseases (at whatever level of
detail researchers find useful) but create links between diseases, so
that a doctor can indicate that one condition has caused, exacerbated,
or hidden another. The Semantic Web is an example of how this can be
done,
and <a href="https://dkm.fbk.eu/index.php/ICD-10_Ontology">ontologies
for ICD-10 already exist</a>. Of course, representing relationships
will still be a complicated task, and better tools for doctors and
coders can help.

</p>

<a name="coordinated_care">
<h2>Coordinated care: teams and telehealth</h2>
</a>

<p>

The current health doctrine urges us to see people not as patients
encountering the health care system through a set of discrete visits,
but as full humans needing lifetime care. Indeed, this is the only way
to treat chronic conditions, which are the health concerns of affluent
nations. (As countries' wealth increases, their health problems change
from predominantly acute conditions such as infections to chronic
conditions such as heart failure and diabetes, a shift called an
"epidemiological transition.") These conditions--lung cancer, liver
cirrhosis, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease--are also called
"lifestyle" diseases. Now, there are plenty of chronic diseases that
we don't blame on the life choices of the victims--such as autoimmune
disease--but these conditions still strongly to individual behavioral
choices and need to be managed in their daily lives.

</p>

<p>

Therefore, researchers urge doctors to adopt a "systems perspective"
in medical care. Viewing a patient as a system that constantly
attempts to adapt to a changing environment can help a great deal in
the long-term planning required for today's chronic conditions. And
the patient's "system" is not only her body, but her mental attitude,
desires, and fears. Systems thinking also places a patient within a
family and a community, which is crucial to effecting change. Working
in an environment where lots of people smoke cigarettes, for instance,
not only exposes a person to second-hand smoke but weakens their
resolve to stay away from cigarettes.

</p>

<p>

Health care itself is also a system, naturally. And it helps not only
to view a clinic or hospital as a system, but to see the treatment
team that surrounds each patients as one. Indeed, the patient's
relationship with a single physician is no longer enough. The
physician must integrate tightly with other staff who deal with the
patient--all the more since nowadays, given the doctor shortage, nurse
practitioners and physician assistants do more in the sphere
previously reserved for doctors. The system must now broaden to
include the patient herself. Health IT tools can pull patient,
physician, and other experts such as physical therapists, social
workers, and nutritionists into a functioning team.

</p>

<p>

Despite the increasing focus on chronic illness by health
professionals, acute diseases still require prompt attention. The
risk of epidemics grows with the concentration of people into large
cities and their greater mobility, as a
<a href="http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/health/245375571.html">recent
international initiative shows</a>. That article mentions the use of
motorcycles to report incidents. Digital technology can combine
reports from individuals over mobile networks, data analysis, and
coordination among health responders to deal with acute break-outs.

</p>

<p>

A consortium of providers trying to avert the need for hospital
admissions have formalized patient/clinician relationships in
the <a href="http://pcmh.ahrq.gov">patient centered medical home</a>
(PCMH),
which <a href="http://ahier.blogspot.com/2009/10/patient-centered-medical-home.html">covers
new options in treatment, monitoring, and reimbursement</a>. Patient
engagement in the home doesn't require technology: it could be
achieved through follow-up phone calls and visits. But digital
technologies can make the care less expensive and more responsive. The
burden on both patients and caregivers can be lightened a great deal
through technology, whether it's simple reports by a patient via phone
or sensors that track such things as whether she is moving around the
house, how her weight changes each day, and whether she takes her
medication.

</p>
<p>

Many PCMH initiatives depend on close
human contact such as visiting nurses, with minimal
technology. Studies show
that <a href="http://www.hitconsultant.net/2013/09/11/rhode-island-patient-centered-medical-home-pilot-reduces-ed-visits/">these
innovations reduce hospital admissions for chronically ill
patients</a>, and particularly
<a
href="http://www.pcpcc.org/sites/default/files/1658_McCarthy_care_transitions_synthesis_v2.pdf">re-admissions
within 30 days after being discharged from a hospital</a>, a measure
that has excited hospital administrators ever since the Centers for
Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services started in 2012 to penalize hospitals
for such readmissions.

</p>

<p>

Keeping patients in their homes can contribute considerably to
improved quality of life and can reduce costs by reducing dependence
on assisted care facilities. As we've seen, making the patient feel
like an empowered partner, rather than a disparaged target of
snooping, is key to success.

</p>
<p>

What comes after the PCMH? Naturally,
the <a href="http://www.govhealthit.com/news/cms-funded-medical-neighborhood-pilot-launch-month">patient-centered
medical neighborhood</a>, which uses data about all patients in a
clinician's practice to draw conclusions about public health. This
local use of data, however, just hints at the power released by
integrating data across societies, a theme we'll explore more under
<a href="#aco_integrated">accountable care organizations</a>.

</p>

<p>

Telehealth--a term I'll use in preference to telemedicine, which
evokes a narrower range of activities--allows experts anywhere in the
world to weigh in on diagnosis. In many poor areas of the world
lacking doctors, a patient can take a picture of a condition with a
cell phone and sends it to a doctor for evaluation. More commonly, a
patient or doctor contacts the expert over an Internet video
hook-up. The high end of telehealth is the remote monitoring of ICU
patients, which sounds sub-optimal but
can <a href="http://www.ihealthbeat.org/articles/2013/12/6/study-icu-telehealth-use-can-boost-survival-rates-speed-discharge">actually
do better by patients than depending on staff in the unit</a>. Social
networks among doctors, which allow them to share stories and ask for
expert advice, may also fall under the umbrella of telehealth.

</p>

<p>

Now we need to consider some of the mechanics behind IT in health. One
requirement looms behind nearly all the advances being
promoted--clinical research, patient empowerment, sensor data,
telehealth, and more: electronic data exchange. The health field needs
the same flexible, powerful capability for data exchanged available to
other organizations all the time to carry out business and research
collaborations. <a href="http://www.hospitalemrandehr.com/2014/01/31/can-major-change-come-from-just-internal-hospital-data">There
is not much to learn from the data collected by any single
hospital</a>, so the institutions have to learn to create large,
combined data sets. They also need to incorporate the data streams
created by all the <a href="#device_sensor">consumer devices described
earlier</a>.

</p>
<p>

Without data exchange:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Sensors are mostly useless--they cannot forward their information to a
central storage point.

</li>

<li>

Clinical research is restricted to what a single lab can do on its
own. This limitation is throttling modern pharmaceutical companies and
academic researchers, who have made all the easy discoveries and are
coming up with fewer and fewer products that pass FDA scrutiny.

</li>

<li>

Patient engagement shrivels, because patients cannot learn what their
doctors know about them or share information among providers.

</li>

<li>

Telehealth is blind, and becomes essentially impossible.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

But the two technologies that permit electronic data exchange in most
fields are crippled in the health care field. Only in the past year or
two have breakthroughs been made, and they are far from being put in
place across providers:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

Formats

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

In digital media, the format defines how bits are laid out in a
document so someone can write a document on one side and someone else
can read it on the other. In electronic health records, HL7 is the
current state of the art in standards for representing patient
records, but it does not provide unified formats; there are too many
loopholes for putting data in odd places or defining proprietary
fields. Furthermore, attempts to adapt to a semi-modern convention,
XML, were done by translating a rather ill-structured older format
into XML, leaving it invalid and therefore hard to parse with standard
XML tools.

</p>
<p>

The Consolidated-Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) in 2011
finally provided a more standard format supporting a wide range of
clinical documents, and it was adopted as a requirement for supporting
Meaningful Use, the government's program to promote adoption of
electronic health records. It is a complex format (taking up a
576-page draft specification) and still allows for proprietary
extensions, a concession that is probably necessary to promote
innovation.

</p>

</dd>

<dt>

Exchange protocols

</dt>

<dd>

<p>

In digital transmissions, protocols are the rules for opening and
closing connections, authenticating and authorizing correspondents,
and other mechanisms needed to create and maintain a connection. The
first standard protocol defined in the health care
field, <a href="http://www.connectopensource.org">CONNECT</a>, began
as a government effort as late as 2008 and uses very heavy-weight
elements such as SAML
(see <a href="http://www.connectopensource.org/blog/2012-04-04-0000/how-did-we-implement-nationwide-health-information-network-specifications">the
CONNECT site</a>) or UDDI
(see <a href="http://www.omg.org/news/meetings/workshops/SOA-HC/presentations-10/13_E1_Riley.pdf">pages
12-13 of this PDF</a>). Similarly complex and little-used SOAP
technologies <a href="http://wiki.ihe.net/index.php?title=XDS.b_Implementation">underlie
the data exchange standard</a> used by institutions to share health
records.

</p>

<p>

Now the government is pulling the health care
field behind two much more feasible
standards, <a href="http://wiki.directproject.org/">Direct</a> for
secure message exchange and
<a href="http://www.directtrust.org/">DirectTrust</a> for creating an
infrastructure that validates the users on each side of the exchange.
These do not guarantee, however, that doctors (and much less patients)
can exchange records,
because <a href="http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2014/02/01/teach-your-emr-to-do-email-impossible-maybe-not/">large organizations may block attempts at authentication</a>.

</p>

</dd>

</dl>

<p>

Current standards have by no means solved the data exchange problem.
The C-CDA is designed for the exchange of large documents, as the D in
its name suggests. But as people collect data from devices and send
them to doctors, they need protocols and formats appropriate for tiny,
frequent transmissions.

</p>

<p>

A robust electronic system would allow patients to share some parts of
their records but not others--for instance, letting a orthopedist see
records related to sports injuries but not mental health. This
flexibility, known as <em>data segmentation</em>, has been widely
endorsed in the field but has many critics, including EHR vendors who
decry the complexity it would add to their products and physicians who
are afraid they'll be liable for data to which they were denied
access. Still, it appears in a major 2010 recommendation on health
records by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and
Technology (see pp. 65-66 of
the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-health-it-report.pdf">PDF</a>).

</p>

<a name="hie">
<h3>Health information exchanges</h3>
</a>

<p>

The Internet permits any two sites using the same protocol to exchange
data, a convenience we take advantage of hundreds of times a day. Why
shouldn't health data be exchanged just as easily? This is the goal of
health information exchange (HIE), a term referring both to the act of
sharing records and to institutions who exist solely to facilitate
that exchange.

</p>

<p>

The security of sensitive patient data is a concern here. Drilled into
the anxieties of administrators by HIPAA and other laws, a concern for
security has often been used as an excuse for refusing to use HIE. But
security shouldn't be any more of a problem than it is for financial
information or sensitive corporate secrets. Despite recurring
compromises, banking and other most other institutions depend on
digital exchange. Indeed, clinicians use the Internet all the time for
billing, the transmission of medical images, and other communications;
it's only treatment for patients that gets short shrift.

</p>

<p>

HIE has historically been tied up with expensive organizations that
specialize in this area, which is like having to go to a special
online broker to place your book order at Amazon.com. Because doctors
had little incentive to give away the information they gathered about
a patient, these organizations usually lasted only as long as a state
agency,
the <a href="http://www.hospitalemrandehr.com/2014/01/29/nyc-health-systems-get-7m-to-share-data">US
government</a>, or some other outside funder was willing to pour
millions of dollars into them. HIEs depended on proprietary software
and offered little added value over a fax machine. Worst of all, they
violated patient trust by selling data, taking advantage of a loophole
in
HIPAA. <a href="http://ehrintelligence.com/2013/12/20/health-information-exchange-grew-by-leaps-and-bounds-in-2013/">Recent
efforts to rescue the concept</a> still don't show long-term
viability.

</p>

<p>

The very existence of HIEs was predicated on two problems: the
difficulty of translating documents between formats, and the
difficulty of matching patients. Each EHR vendor presented data in a
different format, as we have seen. So to serve hospitals
using <em>N</em> different vendors, an HIE would either
need <em>N</em><sup>2</sup> forms of translation software or develop
its own internal format along with code to translate it to and from
the format used by each vendor. Just to integrate systems within a
single institution, hospitals may pay specialized vendors tens of
millions of dollars to do what takes a few dozen lines of code and
some standard software libraries in other industries.

</p>

<p>

The United States, unlike many countries, has no unique, universal
identifier for residents. Although officially states are supposed to
implement the REAL ID act of 2005 in their ID cards, public fears over
identity theft and surveillance have kept the government from
enforcing the law. Therefore, clinicians and HIEs use up to 17
different identifiers (such as name, address, age, and birth date) to
figure out whether a patient seen by one hospital is currently at
another. A <href="http://www.ihe.net/technical_framework/upload/ihe_iti_suppl_pix_pdq_hl7v3_rev2-1_ti_2010-08-10.pdf">153-page
specification</a> defines the Patient Demographic Query and Patient
Identifier Cross-Reference standards that institutions use
to <a href="http://www.openempi.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2654507">ask
about the presence of patients and make the
match</a>. <a href="http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/blogs/what-hios-can-learn-from-the-onc-patient-matching-report-47152-1.html">Mistakes
often lead to loss of life.</a>

</p>
<p>

The US government is working on a voluntary identification system
call <a href="http://www.nist.gov/nstic/">Trusted Identities in
Cyberspace (NSTIC)</a>, based on certificates not much different from
those that validate web sites, but the system is far from ready.

</p>
<p>

All this groaning infrastructure has been put in place so health
providers can hoard data from their patients, perhaps exploiting it
for marketing while preventing other doctors from using it to improve
care. Naturally, it would be simpler just to leave data in patient
hands. The patient would just point a doctor to her online records
before a visit. Professional services would crop up to help patients
who don't want to manage their own records. To cope with rare
occasions when a patient is incoherent or unconscious (fears raised
repeatedly by professionals opposed to patient control over data),
patients could carry emergency phone numbers for relatives or other
agents to whom they have granted access their to records. Smartcards
have also been proposed to hold critical patient information.

</p>
<p>

Recent changes in the field have led to slightly more success in the
HIE area.

</p>

<ul>

<li>

The CONNECT and Direct protocols discussed
in <a href="#coordinated_care">the section on data exchange</a>, once
they were supported by EHR vendors, allowed clinicians and HIEs to
dispense with some of the complicated translation software they
previously needed.

</li>

<li>

Some HIEs realize they must provide more value than simply shuttling
data between health care providers. These more forward-looking
organizations typically provide patient stratification to their
clients, using their knowledge of patient diagnoses to identify
at-risk patients. These are the key contributions of
the <a href="http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/beacon-community-program">Beacon
Communities</a> set up by the government as testbeds for modern,
coordinated care.

</li>

<li>

Software vendors are providing various solutions to exchange and
interoperability problems, often in middleware that an EHR vendor can
use.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Yet despite these
advances, <a href="http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/hie-survey-offers-sobering-results-on-value-47151-1.html">few
HIEs are surviving</a>. It is time to remove them from the equation
and use standards such as Direct to enable data exchange between
doctor and patient, or between doctors under the control of the
patient.

</p>

<a name="aco_integrated">
<h3>Accountable care organizations and other integrated care</h3>
</a>

<p>

Most developed countries take responsibility for their entire
populations over long periods of time, and therefore have frameworks
that potentially can handle (even if imperfectly implemented)
integrated, long-term treatments of chronic conditions. Such health
systems exist in the United States as well--the Department of Veterans
Affairs and Kaiser Permanente, mentioned earlier, and the Indian
Health Services--but most US residents have care provided episodically
by doctors, hospitals, and insurers, who do not commit to long-term
responsibility for the patient's health or collect data over long
periods of time.

</p>

<p>

The payment and policy issues created by this situation lie beyond the
scope of this article, but we can certainly look at the IT that would
be required by an integrated health system.

</p>

<p>

Thus, the biggest upheaval in American health care in the 2010s decade
may be the attempt by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services
to reorganize hospitals and clinics into consortia with comprehensive
responsibility for patients'
health. Called <a href="www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/ACO">accountable
care organizations</a>, it encourages clinics and hospitals to combine
and offer complete services to patients--in short, to act more like the
Department of Veterans Affairs.

</p>

<p>

CMS encourages ACOs to reduce costs through incentives that work
against the old toxic model of paying for each visit. Each patient in
a certain category (such as certain types of heart disease) is assumed
to cost a certain amount to treat. The ACO is rewarded for keeping
costs below this threshold. The plan is a step toward global payments,
which pay the health provider a fixed sum to take care of a defined
population.

</p>

<p>

Determining how much a particular patient should "cost" is a difficult
judgment that requires better data than we have now. Furthermore, the
three-year period for which an ACO is considered responsible for a
patient may not be long enough to see improvements in chronic
conditions. But the problems with ACOs go deeper.

</p>

<p>

Few ACOs have been set up yet. CMS presents early evidence that
<a href="http://www.healthdatamanagement.com/news/cms-medicare-medicaid-acos-are-saving-money-47194-1.html">ACOs
are saving money</a>, probably by picking off the low-hanging
fruit. (Without technological
razzle-dazzle, <a href="http://iom.edu/~/media/Files/Perspectives-Files/2013/Commentaries/VSRT-ValueBasedCare.pdf">Blue
Cross Blue Shield also announced significant cost savings from
value-based care</a>.) A successful ACO meets
the <a href="http://www.ihi.org/offerings/Initiatives/TripleAim/Pages/default.aspx">"triple
aim"</a> in health care--improving the patient experience, achieving
better health, and lowering costs--through such data-rich activities
as:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Tracking the patient from primary care to specialist to hospital to
physical therapist and so on, making sure the patient follows up on
recommended treatments.

</li>

<li>

Sharing a patient's records expeditiously among all the clinicians
working with the patient.

</li>

<li>

Crunching data about patient conditions and outcomes to find where
treatments succeed or fail.

</li>

<li>

Using this longitudinal data to predict trends, which could help
apportion resources more efficiently and even contributes to public
health.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

In the best case, fixed payments and rigorously monitored
outcomes--both are necessary to make the ACO work--will inspire
providers to look for efficiencies.

</p>

<p>

Essentially, to be successful, an ACO has to exchange data seamlessly
as the patient moves through its system. One might think of ACOs as
bringing health information exchange within the boundaries of the
cooperating providers (or as a defense against the ideal of enabling
health information exchange throughout the health care system). As we
have seen, current EHR systems are not capable of seamless
exchange. ACOs are also at constant risk because a patient has the
right to get care from someone outside the ACO. They need powerful
incentives to keep each patient within their system.

</p>

<p>

So the problems faced by ACOs are best solved on a more global level;
each ACO lacks the wherewithal to solve it themselves. In particular:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Data exchange requires robust, easy-to-implement standards that should
be reached at a national or even international level. To glom together
many local hospitals and clinics into ACO and expect them to harmonize
their record systems is too much to ask. The problems of current ACOs
show
how <a href="http://ehrintelligence.com/2014/01/22/what-do-acos-reveal-about-the-importance-of-integration/">integration
through data sharing is both critical and hard for them to
achieve</a>.

</li>

<li>

Decision support and public health are facilitated by huge data
sets. The more institutions combine to exchange data, the more they
can learn. As we shall see, a national public health plan could be
built on data stored by patients and shared at their
discretion. Although some individual hospitals have learned valuable
lessons by tracking their own data, and Kaiser Permanente has achieved
a lot by exploiting its huge scale, a national health system would
generate far better data than the amount an ACO can collect.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

A perennial complaint of health reformers has been the isolation of
data and decision making by individual doctors and institutions--data
silos, as they are called. ACOs just create bigger silos needing
standards for data
sharing and interoperability. They also risk raising costs
by creating larger, more powerful players--a risk CMS is apparently
willing to take because of the chance they can lower costs through
better coordination. But I consider ACOs an experiment whose lessons
can be eventually applied in a national plan.

</p>

Because large collections of data are needed for more accurate
statistical analyses, interesting public health benefits are coming
from organizations that manage to get their hands of data from lots of
patients: services chosen by patients such as PatientsLikeMe and
Web-based EHRs. By centralizing patient data, these companies can look
for trends. For instance, when the 2013 federal government shutdown
forced the Centers for Disease Control to stop tracking incidents of
the flu,
<a href="http://www.athenahealth.com/blog/2013/10/04/athenaresearch-tracking-flu-activity-during-the-cdc-furlough/">Athenahealth
filled the gap</a>. However, as we'll see, privacy is better protected
if patients store data instead of relying on either doctors or
vendors.

This buzzword has been applied broadly to many aspects of health
care. Examples include:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Contacts by phone or text messages to remind patients of basic care,
such as coming to doctor's appointments or taking their medications.
<a href="https://app.preventnow.com/how_it_works">Prevent</a> goes
farther, linking people at risk for diabetes with coaches and other
participants over a mobile device. Rudimentary technologies can be
used in very sophisticated ways. For instance, recruiting a family
member to text a patient may produce a better outcome than receiving
an impersonal text message from the clinic.

</li>

<li>

Remote consultations. These may take place between a patient and a
doctor, or between a doctor and a specialist. Although the use of

video connections for mental health treatment wa disparaged for a
long time, some patients find it helpful. One intense variant of the
remote consultation is
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18305328">remote intensive
care</a>. Intensive care units are laden with sensors, which can be
monitored by experts outside the center just as easily as by nurses on
the floor. Some studies suggest that remote ICU monitoring can save
money and catch problems that would be missed by busy nurses present
on the ICU. Technology now also allows remote monitoring of trauma
patients while they're being brought in from the scene of the trauma.

</li>

<li>

Contacts with patients in their own
homes, <a href="#individual_home">discussed earlier</a>.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Remote medicine changes the health equation for people living in areas
underserved by doctors, such as rural areas and developing
nations. Ordinary residents of poor areas, even children, can be
taught to run phone apps that walk them through questions to help
determine what is wrong with a patient. They can also take photos of
afflicted areas of the body and send them to doctors in cities better
served by clinics. One example is a
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-25986841">modified mobile
phone</a> that can take pictures of the eye</a>.

</p>

<p>

Many applications of telemedicine simply extend the reach of a doctor,
not much different from placing a telephone call. The model of health
care remains the traditional one in these situations, albeit with some
convenience for the patient and cost savings. Truly transformative
telehealth involves a large set of the technologies we have examined
for collecting, exchanging, and analyzing data.

</p>

<p>

Payment models need to change drastically to accommodate
telehealth. Currently, most payers won't even reimburse a doctor for
using email or the telephone to advise a patient instead of a visit to
the
office. But <a href="http://www.americantelemed.org/docs/default-source/policy/state-telemedicine-legislation-matrix.pdf">many
states are preparing legislation to allow telemedicine</a>, and a
<a
href="http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/new-bill-breaks-down-telehealth-barriers">simple
bill introduced into Congress</a> would promote consultations with
doctors over state lines. Because doctors are comfortable initiating
consultations and patients in underserved areas crave contact with
professionals, telehealth should become very popular once the
enabling factors are in place.

</p>


<a name="coordinated_care_barrier">
<h3>Barriers to coordinated care</h3>
</a>

<p>

The main barriers to data exchange are institutional decisions.
Hospital and clinic administrators know that making data portable will
ease the way for patients to find other providers, should they choose
to do so. ACOs, like bilateral or regional trade treaties, are formed
to preserve the same competitive advantages while allowing care to
improve within the ACO. EHR vendors undermine interoperable standards
(to the point of lobbying on relevant legislation and regulation) for
the sake of their clients as well as to preserve barriers to entry in
their own markets. Pharmaceutical companies and clinical researchers
guard secrets to further their careers.

</p>

<p>

Many health practitioners claim that regulations raise barriers to
useful data exchange, thereby holding back coordinated care. The heavy
weight of regulation cannot be denied: in the US we have the famous
HIPAA law, continually augmented by hundreds of pages of interpret
regulations that change every few years, plus many state laws
specifically dealing with health privacy.  But this is an area of much
contentious debate, with many sophisticated clinical and IT leaders
saying that HIPAA does not have to restrict useful data sharing and
that it is simply misinterpreted by providers.

</p>

<p>

In fact, as we have seen, HIPAA has limited scope and fails to cover
important privacy gaps. For instance, its "safe harbor" method of
deidentifying patient data predates current advances in security and
privacy protection, and thus is
both <a href="http://www.privacyanalytics.ca/on-the-limits-of-the-hipaa-safe-harbor-de-identification-standard/">woefully
inadequate and unnecessarily restrictive</a>. On the positive side,
regulations were recently updated to ensure that
<a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/coveredentities/businessassociates.html">business
associate to whom health providers gave patient data had to comply
with the law</a>. Business associates are companies to which health
provider outsource things such as billing and analytics, and who
should not be taking advantage of the patient data given to them for
other purposes.

</p>

<p>

But even accounting for all those considerations, we also have to
acknowledge technical barriers to health information exchange and
consequently to coordinated care.

</p>

<ul>

<li>

As explained under <a href="#ehr_barrier">barriers to decision
support</a>, people are inherently variable, so data exchange could be
comparing apples to oranges.

</li>

<li>

Data collected by researchers is just as variable as data from medical
records. One researcher will collect data under different temperatures
or other conditions from a researcher next door, or divide the data
into different categories.

</li>

<li>

Errors are rife in medical records, whether on paper or in the
computer. It has been estimated that everybody's record has
errors. These weaken the validity of conclusions based on data
processing. Statisticians and data scientists have developed
algorithms to compensate for suspicious data fields, which makes the
data more usable in the aggregate. But algorithms don't actually
correct the data, which needs the patient's own eye.

</li>

<li>

As mentioned under <a href="#barrier_device">barriers to the use of
devices</a>, integrating information submitted by patients and their
devices has its own challenges.

</li>

<li>

There is no simple way, as discussed in
the <a href="#clinical_research">section on clinical research</a>, to
obtain flexible consent from patients for the use of their data.

</li>

<li>

Segmentation may turn out to be a mirage, even if the considerable
technical barriers are overcome. For instance, if a patient asked the
doctor to segment his diagnosis and treatment for an STD, the doctor
would have to properly tag everything from the visit and the lab test
to the diagnostic code and the medication assigned. It's too easy for
a lab test or medication list to give away the truth, even if a
diagnosis is hidden.

</li>

</ul>

<a name="engagement_games">
<h2>Patient empowerment and health-enhancing games</h2>
</a>

<p>

Everything we've seen in health IT advances so far point to a bigger
role for individuals in their own health care. Health experts like to
talk about "patient engagement" or "patient satisfaction,"
condescending terms that suggest the doctor has all the answers but to
make stupid or recalcitrant patients comply. Patient advocates prefer
the term "patient empowerment" and replay "compliance" with
"adherence." The very term "patient," reeking of passivity and
helplessness, irks some advocates,
but <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2013/05/the-elusive-quest-to-transform-healthcare-through-patient-empowerment.html">other
terms such "consumer" have problems too</a>.

</p>

<p>

The psychological, organizational, and policy implications of patient
empowerment (or even engagement) are huge, but this article focuses on
the role of computing and data. How can health IT help move care to
its new locus, the individual? We have already
discussed <a href="#individual_home">patient-centered medical
homes</a>, <a href="#qs_selves">Quantified Self</a>,
and <a href="#clinical_research">openings in clinical_research</a>,
but less obvious changes can suffuse through many other areas of the
health care field.

</p>

<a name="without_doctor">
<h3>Health care without a doctor</h3>
</a>

<p>

Insensitive doctors sometimes act as if the patient was not a
factor. People are turning the tables now, engaging in many
health-related activities without involving clinicians. And today's
technology is replete with playthings and baubles for the motivated
individual--often acting in collaboration with peers. But they can
show real benefits.

</p>

<p>

For instance, a number of mobile
apps <a href="http://www.fiercehealthit.com/special-reports/7-health-technologies-veterans-mobile-apps">help
veterans manage stress and mood<a>, while several apps such
as <a href="http://stompstaging.telus-nas.com/FAQ.aspx">STOMP</a>
offer regular encouragement to tobacco smokers who want to quit.
Games improving brain performance are a particularly popular niche.
Sites such
as <a href="http://about.onehealth.com/howitworks/">OneHealth</a>
and <a href="http://www.proteus.com/todays-products/for-professionals/">Helius</a>
are broader and more strategic, setting up plans for patients to
follow in their daily lives.

</p>

<p>

People often use social networking sites with which they are already
familiar, such as Facebook, to form communities around health issues.
Others choose specialized sites, such as PatientsLikeMe. People can
even <a href="https://www.hulahq.com/">share test results with
potential sexual partners</a> to provide assurances they are free of
STDs.

</p>

<a name="gamification">
<h3>Gamification</h3>
</a>

<p>

One exciting area of health research is
the <a href="http://strata.oreilly.com/2012/06/games-for-health-covers-curren.html">use
of video games</a>. All types of games can be impressed into service
in the pursuit of better health: mental challenges, role-playing games
(sometimes for clinicians as well as patients), competitions, and even
the old stand-by, first person shooter games.

</p>

<p>

A game is an automated form of patient engagement, along the lines of
text messages reminding them to take their medication, but infinitely
more powerful. No one has to ask a patient to be engaged; with a game
he chooses to be so.

</p>

<p>

It may not be surprising that games can ameliorate mental conditions
such as Attention Deficit Disorder or Post-Traumatic Stress
Syndrome. Perhaps more thought-provoking is their role in helping
<a href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/candy-crush-stroke-patients">stroke
victims</a> and cancer patients recover. And
the <a href="http://rockhealth.com/2013/07/games-for-health-the-latest/">combination
of games and devices</a> creates a whole new playing field for medical
research. For some people, games outperform medications in every way,
proving in some conditions to
be <a href="http://www.mhealthnews.com/news/gamification-secret-cutting-care-costs-mHealth-mobile">cheaper</a>,
more effective, less dangerous, longer-lasting in their effects--and
of course more fun.

</p>

<p>

Why do people love games? There are several possible explanations,
including the story-telling suggested by a game and the way it makes
people feel they're in control. The feeling of control is a bit odd,
because every detail presented to them on the screen--assuming it's a
video game--has been planned and programmed. In any case, games feel
like the ultimate in putting the patient in control. Games also make
maximum use of feedback loops, which people use in all areas of life
(and health) to encourage positive thinking and behavior.

</p>

<p>

Many games are also social. One can compete with others for
achievements and at the same time feel spurred on by their support and
cameraderie to make behavior changes.

</p>

<a name="transparency">
<h3>Transparency</h3>
</a>

<p>

Economists and other observers of the health care industry understand
that it is not a market. Many wish that it was a true market--a level
playing field where patients knew the costs of care, the quality of
the provider, and all their options. But in the United States, all too
often:

</p>

<ul>

<li>

Not even the provider knows how much a patient will pay until the
insurance payer issues a statement, often after the procedure has
taken place. Prices are set in secret negotiations between providers
and insurers and vary among patients.

</li>

<li>

Hospitals conceal the rate of complications, rehospitalizations, and
deaths from procedures, and even though governments often collect such
information, they rarely publicize it so that patients can compare
doctors. Industry experts know quite well
that <a href="http://capsules.kaiserhealthnews.org/index.php/2014/01/expensive-hospitals-strong-reputations-but-little-evidence-of-better-care-study-finds/">reputation
is a poor guide to actual quality</a>. To top off the problem, patient
ratings are mostly irrelevant, being based more on the quality of the
food or the amount of noise in the corridor (not that these are
unimportant) than the success or failure of procedures.

</li>

<li>

Physicians try to present alternative treatments (including the
alternative of no treatment) to patients, but it's hard to predict the
relative success of each treatment. Genetic analysis can often
indicate what will work for a particular patient. Many new treatments
come along that doctors aren't aware of. The success rate of more
experimental treatments may be unknown.

</li>

</ul>

<p>

Governments have started
<a href="https://data.medicare.gov/Nursing-Home-Compare/Quality-Measures-Short-Stay/u8my-ac5x">releasing
data about hospital quality</a>, and some intrepid sites such
as <a href="http://clearhealthcosts.com/">Clear Health Costs</a> use
public data sets and crowdsourcing to build support for patients
trying to compare costs. Some worry that making prices public will
actually lead some facilities to raise prices. But when the day comes
that everyone can see the price and outcome of popular procedures, the
market will take over and crush institutions that are providing bad
care or overcharging.

</p>

<a name="patient_control">
<h3>Patient control over data</h3>
</a>

<p>

What have seen in our tour through modern health care in this article?
That patients can benefit from the output of sensors and monitoring,
which is by definition their own data. That electronic records are the
basis of better care, but are most secure and available when the
patient has control over them. When you think about it, patient
empowerment is meaningless without patient control over data.

</p>

<p>

As mentioned earlier, doctors routinely ignore the legal requirement
to show patients their health
records. The <a href="http://www.myopennotes.org/what-is-opennotes-2/">OpenNotes</a>
advocacy organization
found <a href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=1363511">several
advantages to providing simple patient portals</a>, such as patients
taking their prescribed medications more often. But a patient portal
is still not as empowering as records that patients maintain
themselves.

</p>

<p>

Two major projects have offered patients a place to keep their own
health records: Google Health and
<a href="https://www.healthvault.com/">Microsoft
HealthVault</a>. Google closed its service because it wasn't taking
off, and adopters of HealthVault are also fairly sparse. Many
explanations for these lackluster results have circulated, some based
on the services' difficulty of use or lack of features, others based
on the resistance put up by physicians, providers, and payers, who
feel threatened by patient-owned data and want control for their own
financial benefit. In any case, it's clear something big has to change
to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gpk-fbfg4Y">give patients
their damn data (video)</a>.

</p>

<p>

One feature of the winning electronic health system is sure to be free
software, which already offers several promising developments:

</p>

<dl>

<dt>

<a href="http://indivohealth.org/">Indivo</a> to store data

</dt>

<dd>

An inspiration for Google Health and an actual source of some of
HealthVault's source code, Indivo is a free software personal health
record. It
includes <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/06/clinician-researcher-and-patie.html">an
API to let other EHRs upload data to it</a>--but no simple way to
download data in bulk, because the developers' goal is leave data
under the patient's control.

</dd>

<dt>

<a href="http://www.healthit.gov/bluebutton">Blue Button</a> to
download data from EHRs

</dt>

<dd>

This project, the brainchild of the Department of Veterans Affairs,
has become a standard for the whole health industry. When Blue Button
started, the project was simplicity itself: a patient could press a
button on the health provider's web site and receive a down-and-dirty,
plain text list of his conditions, treatments, and other facts. A more
structured XML format has been developed to make the data friendlier
for apps as well as human readers.

</dd>

<dt>

<a href="http://wiki.directproject.org/">Direct</a> for data exchange

</dt>

<dd>

Introduced in the <a href="#coordinated_care">data exchange section of
this article</a>, Direct makes secure exchange of patient data
possible even if both sides have nothing more sophisticated than
email. Because encrypted email is so rare, most users will have to
contract with a web site to protect the transmission, but they'll have
to use it anyway to authenticate the person with whom they want to
exchange data.

</dd>

</dl>

<p>

Health providers are gradually putting data in the cloud to reduce
costs, improve security, and make access easier, so there is no reason
the records shouldn't be under the control of the patient instead of
the provider. Smart cards, which have been used in France and other
countries for many years, may also work in tandem with personal health
records, making it
<a href="http://www.healthitoutcomes.com/doc/a-strong-case-for-smart-cards-in-healthcare-0001">easy for patients to bring their data to many health
providers</a>.

</p>

<p>

But even if someone weaves all these technologies into an appealing
and usable patient record, how can patients be encouraged to use the
records, and doctors encouraged to consult them? The key to progress
returns, perhaps, to the very first element of health reform listed in
this article: sensors worn by patients to preserve their observations
of daily living. Such data could grow in value to become
indispensable, whereupon doctors and their EHRs will have to open up
to patient-maintained records.

</p>

<p>

Several leading health IT groups have
<a href="http://mobihealthnews.com/27825/industry-groups-to-hhs-include-patient-generated-data-in-mu-stage-3/">asked
the Department of Health and Human Services</a> to require health
providers to accept patient data in Stage 3 of Meaningful Use. But
because consumer devices also report their results to data silos
maintained by the device's vendor, the patient must also be able to
run a simple program to capture the data, either from the device or
from the vendor's site.

</p>

<p>

When patients insert data into records, encoding them with
a <em>provenance</em> becomes even more important. It's always
valuable to know how data was obtained, but doctors are particularly
cautious about measurements that were taken outside the clinical
setting.

</p>

<p>

Patients have <a href="http://reginaholliday.blogspot.com/">been
advocating for access to their records for many decades</a>, but
technology is finally emerging to back up their demands. This article
has hopefully suggested some of the significant advances that the
health care field can make when their demands are met.

</p>

<a name="closing">
<h2>General closing thoughts</h2>
</a>

<p>

It's no coincidence that President Obama--along with many other
presidents
from <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/3/399.full">Harry
Truman</a>
through <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~starr/20starr.html">Bill
Clinton</a>--made health care reform central to his administration.
Americans are facing multiple health crises, whether from the effects
of obesity or the tragedy of drug addiction. Health costs are
bankrupting the nation--when people talk about the federal deficit,
they are largely referring to Medicare's expected payouts. And
Americans are just plain terrified by the prospect of getting sick and
not being able to get treatment.

</p>

<p>

And although the United States spends far more than other nations for
health, without commensurate outcomes, the problems are not limited to
this country. The entire world is aging, while breakthroughs in
treatments raise expectations for care.

</p>

<p>

Conservative views among payers, providers, and administrators are
understandable. People can get hurt if something goes wrong, and
decades of fail-safe practices to protect patients have been built up
that put a damper on experimentation. The consequences of a bug or
missed step are far greater than dropping an update to a social
network.

</p>

<p>

It is not within the scope of this article to discuss health care
policy. As for fears that the Affordable Care Act will raise costs,
I'll simply say--if you provide people with health insurance but don't
actually make them healthier, sure, costs will go up.

</p>

<p>

Thus, regardless of the fate of the ACA or of political controversies,
it is critical for societies to make use of available data. Patients
must get their data and must be encouraged to provide it to
researchers. Analytics must be made widely available and used
sensitively to reveal the places where health care can improve. The
improvements may be as simple as a reminder phone call, as
sophisticated as the identification of sick neighborhoods, or as
dazzling as the discovery of new miracle drugs. Technology and social
change will meld to create medical progress, regardless
of <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/02/04/veteran-vc-says-beware-of-health-it-bubble-not-enough-actual-business-plans/">any
hype or overinvestment that may be taking place in the early 2010
decade</a>.

</p>

<p>

People in high-tech like to lecture the health care field to adopt
more of a "Silican Valley mentality." While the meaning of that phrase
is vague, it usually suggests hackers making prototypes and rolling
out rapid updates, and being funded by open-handed venture capitalists
(except after bubbles burst). But in my view, these activities are not
the most important aspects of success in the Silicon Valley.
Furthermore, the modus operandi is not appropriate for health. In
health, the consequences of bug are not just a message informing a
visitor she cannot post a photo. It could mean that a patient is
missing urgent treatment, or being given too much radiation.

</p>

<p>

The true energy behind the "Silican Valley mentality" lies in the
inquisitive people who might nightly in basements, kitchens, and
hacker spaces all over the region to show what they've been doing
lately, discuss problems, and come up with solutions together. This is
not taking hold in health IT. User groups meet for various products,
but everyone overall--hospitals, researchers, EHR consultants--is
trying to preserve secrets and use other people's ignorance to their
competitive advantage. Only in hackathons can one find an open
attitude toward making progress. Until health IT experts form
communities to discuss what's bothering them and seek common ground,
there will be little of the Silicon Valley mentality in health
care--and little reform either.

</p>

<p>

In a health care field dominated by chronic illness, health lies in
the hands of each of us. But we can't get better unless we work
together. Sensors, data, electronic records, data sharing, and open
source software are all part of that collaboration.
