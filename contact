Long article on Health IT for O'Reilly

For a long time, I've been thinking that health IT needs an overview
article that pulls together the various trends that people have talked
about, but without the gee-whiz dazzle that besets many predictions.
It should be a candid and unflinching look at the technical problems
that health care faces, along with the potential.

This is too big for me--I can produce drafts, but I need many people
to flesh it out. I have just finished my first draft, which is fairly
sleek at 8,500 words. I wonder whether you could look at it over the
next two weeks and help me with it:

It embodies contradictory goals, trying to be comprehensive while also
telling a coherent story. I have also intentionally taken sides and
included controversial opinions. So of course I want to hear from
people who disagree with me.

If the article survives the review process, O'Reilly will publish it
as a short ebook to be distributed free of charge.
